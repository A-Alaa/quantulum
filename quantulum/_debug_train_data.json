steadier timekeeper:th second is defin as be equal to the time durat of period of the radiat correspond to the transit between the two hyperfin level of the fundament unperturb ground-stat of the atom. becaus the earth rotat vari and is also slow ever so slightly, a leap second is period ad to clock time to keep clock in sync with earth rotation. multipl of second are usual count in hour and minutes. fraction of a second are usual count in tenth or hundredths. in scientif work, small fraction of a second are count in millisecond (thousandths), microsecond (millionths), nanosecond (billionths), and sometim smaller unit of a second. an everyday experi with small fraction of a second is a microprocessor which has a cycl time of nanosecond. camera shutter speed are often express in fraction of a second, such as second or second. sexagesim divis of the day from a calendar base on astronom observ have exist sinc the third millennium bc, though they were not second as we know them today. small divis of time could not be measur back then, so such divis were mathemat derived. the first timekeep that could count second accur were pendulum clock invent in the century. start in the atom clock becam better timekeep than earth rotation, and they continu to set the standard today. == clock and solar time == a mechan clock, one which doe not depend on measur the relat rotat posit of the earth, keep uniform time call mean time, within whatev accuraci is intrins to it. that mean that everi second, minut and everi other divis of time count by the clock will be the same durat as ani other ident divis of time. but a sundial which measur the relat posit of the sun in the sky call appar time, doe not keep uniform time. the time kept by a sundial vari by time of year, mean that seconds, minut and everi other divis of time is a differ durat at differ time of the year. the time of day measur with mean time versus appar time may differ by as much as minutes, but a singl day will differ from the next by onli a small amount; minut is a cumul differ over a part of the year. the effect is due chiefli to the obliqu of earth axi with respect to it orbit around the sun. the differ between appar solar time and mean time was recogn by astronom sinc antiquity, but prior to the invent of accur mechan clock in the century, sundial were the onli reliabl timepieces, and appar solar time was the onli general accept standard. == event and unit of time in second == fraction of a second are usual denot in decim notation, for exampl seconds, or two and one hundredth seconds. multipl of second are usual express as minut and seconds, or hours, minut and second of clock time, separ by colons, such as or (the latter notat can give rise to ambiguity, becaus the same notat is use to denot hour and minutes). it rare make sens to express longer period of time like hour or day in seconds, becaus they are awkward larg numbers. for the metric unit of second, there are decim prefix repres to seconds. some common unit of time in second are: a minut is seconds; an hour is seconds; a day is seconds; a week is seconds; a year (other than leap years) is seconds; and a (gregorian) centuri averag seconds; with all of the abov exclud ani possibl leap seconds. some common event in second are: a stone fall about meter from rest in one second; a pendulum of length about one meter has a swing of one second, so pendulum clock have pendulum about a meter long; the fastest human sprinter run meter in a second; an ocean wave in deep water travel about meter in one second; sound travel about meter in one second in air; light take second to reach earth from the surfac of the moon, a distanc of kilometers. == other unit incorpor second == a second is part of other units, such as frequenc measur in hertz (invers second or speed (meter per second) and acceler (meter per second squared). the metric system unit becquerel, a measur of radioact decay, is measur in invers seconds. the meter is defin in term of the speed of light and the second; definit of the metric base unit kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and candela also depend on the second. the onli base unit whose definit doe not depend on the second is the mole. of the name deriv unit of the si, onli two (radian and steradian), do not depend on the second. mani deriv unit for everyday thing are report in term of larger unit of time, not seconds, such as clock time in hour and minutes, veloc of a car in kilomet per hour or mile per hour, kilowatt hour of electr usage, and speed of a turntabl in rotat per minute. == timekeep standard == a set of atom clock throughout the world keep time by consensus: the clock \"vote\" on the correct time, and all vote clock are steer to agre with the consensus, which is call intern atom time (tai). tai \"ticks\" atom seconds.civil time is defin to agre with the rotat of the earth. the intern standard for timekeep is coordin univers time (utc). this time scale \"ticks\" the same atom second as tai, but insert or omit leap second as necessari to correct for variat in the rate of rotat of the earth.a time scale in which the second are not exact equal to atom second is a form of univers time. is defin by the rotat of the earth with respect to the sun, and doe not contain ani leap seconds. alway differ from utc by less than a second. == optic lattic clock == while they are not yet part of ani timekeep standard, optic lattic clock with frequenc in the visibl light spectrum now exist and are the most accur timekeep of all. a strontium clock with frequenc thz, in the red rang of visibl light, now hold the accuraci record: it will gain or lose less than a second in billion years, which is longer than the estim age of the universe. such a clock can measur a chang in it elev of as littl as cm by the chang in it rate due to gravit time dilation. == histori of definit == there have onli ever been three definit of the second: as a fraction of the day, as a fraction of an extrapol year, and as the microwav frequenc of a caesium atom clock, and they have realiz a sexagesim divis of the day from ancient astronom calendars. === sexagesim divis of calendar time and day === civil in the classic period and earlier creat divis of the calendar as well as arc use a sexagesim system of counting, so at that time the second was a sexagesim subdivis of the day (ancient second = not of the hour like the modern second (= sundial and water clock were among the earliest timekeep devices, and unit of time were measur in degre of arc. conceptu unit of time smaller than realiz on sundial were also used. there are refer to second as part of a lunar month in the write of natur philosoph of the middl ages, which were mathemat subdivis that could not be measur mechanically. === fraction of solar day === the earliest mechan clock which appear start in the centuri had display that divid the hour into halves, thirds, quarter and sometim even parts, but never by in fact, the hour was not common divid in minut as it was not uniform in duration. it was not practic for timekeep to consid minut until the first mechan clock that display minut appear near the end of the century. mechan clock kept the mean time, as oppos to the appar time display by sundials. by that time, sexagesim divis of time were well establish in europe.th earliest clock to display second appear dure the last half of the century. the second becam accur measur with the develop of mechan clocks. the earliest spring-driven timepiec with a second hand which mark second is an unsign clock depict orpheus in the fremersdorf collection, date between and dure the quarter of the century, taqi al-din built a clock with mark everi minute. in jost b\u00fcrgi built a clock for william of hess that mark seconds. in tycho brahe redesign clock that had display onli minut at his observatori so they also display seconds, even though those second were not accurate. in tycho complain that his four clock disagre by plus or minus four seconds.in dutch scientist christiaan huygen invent the first pendulum clock. it had a pendulum length of just under a meter which gave it a swing of one second, and an escap that tick everi second. it was the first clock that could accur keep time in seconds. by the year later, john harrison maritim chronomet could keep time accur to within one second in days. in gauss propos use the second as the base unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second system of units. the british associ for the advanc of scienc (baas) in state that \"all men of scienc are agre to use the second of mean solar time as the unit of time.\" baa formal propos the cgs system in although this system was gradual replac over the next year by mks units. both the cgs and mks system use the same second as their base unit of time. mks was adopt intern dure the defin the second as of a mean solar day. === fraction of an ephemeri year === some time in the late quartz crystal oscil clock with an oper frequenc of khz advanc to keep time with accuraci better than part in over an oper period of a day. it becam appar that a consensus of such clock kept better time than the rotat of the earth. metrologist also knew that earth orbit around the sun (a year) was much more stabl than earth rotation. this led to propos as earli as to defin the second as a fraction of a year. the earth motion was describ in newcomb tabl of the sun which provid a formula for estim the motion of the sun relat to the epoch base on astronom observ made between and this result in adopt of an ephemeri time scale express in unit of the sider year at that epoch by the iau in this extrapol timescal bring the observ posit of the celesti bodi into accord with newtonian dynam theori of their motion. in the tropic year, consid more fundament than the sider year, was chosen by the iau as the unit of time. the tropic year in the definit was not measur but calcul from a formula describ a mean tropic year that decreas linear over time. in the second was redefin in term of a year relat to that epoch. the second was thus defin as \"the fraction of the tropic year for januari at hour ephemeri time\". this definit was adopt as part of the intern system of unit in === \"atomic\" second === but even the best mechanical, electr motor and quartz crystal-bas clock develop discrep from environment conditions. far better for timekeep is the natur and exact \"vibration\" in an energ atom. the frequenc of vibrat (i.e., radiation) is veri specif depend on the type of atom and how it is excited. sinc the second has been defin as exact \"the durat of period of the radiat correspond to the transit between the two hyperfin level of the ground state of the atom\" (at a temperatur of k). this length of a second was select to correspond exact to the length of the ephemeri second previous defined. atom clock use such a frequenc to measur second by count cycl per second at that frequency. radiat of this kind is one of the most stabl and reproduc phenomena of nature. the current generat of atom clock is accur to within one second in a few hundr million years. atom clock now set the length of a second and the time standard for the world. == si multipl == si prefix are common use for time shorter than one second, but rare for multipl of a second. instead,

    "in chemistri the amount of substanc in a given sampl of matter is defin as the number of discret atom scale particl in it divid by the avogadro constant na in a truli atomist view the amount of substanc is simpli the number of particl that constitut the substanc the particl or entiti may be molecul atom ion electron or other depend on the context the valu of the avogadro constant na has been defin as mol in the truli atomist view mol particl the avogadro number and therefor the convers constant is simpli na the amount of substanc is sometim refer to as the chemic amount the mole symbol mol is a unit of amount of substanc in the intern system of unit defin sinc by fix the avogadro constant at the given valu histor the mole was defin as the amount of substanc in gram of the isotope. as a consequence, the mass of one mole of a chemic compound, in grams, is numer equal (for all practic purposes) to the mass of one molecul of the compound, in daltons, and the molar mass of an isotop in gram per mole is equal to the mass number. for example, a molecul of water has a mass of about dalton on average, wherea a mole of water (which contain water molecules) has a total mass of about grams. in chemistry, becaus of the law of multipl proportions, it is often much more conveni to work with amount of substanc (that is, number of mole or of molecules) than with mass (grams) or volum (liters). for example, the chemic fact molecul of oxygen will react with molecul of hydrogen to make molecul of water can also be state as mole of will react with mole of to form mole of water\". the same chemic fact, express in term of masses, would be g mole) of oxygen will react with approxim g mole of hydrogen to make approxim g moles) of water\" (and the number would depend on the isotop composit of the reagents). in term of volume, the number would depend on the pressur and temperatur of the reagent and products. for the same reasons, the concentr of reagent and product in solut are often specifi in mole per liter, rather than gram per liter. the amount of substanc is also a conveni concept in thermodynamics. for example, the pressur of a certain quantiti of a nobl gas in a recipi of a given volume, at a given temperature, is direct relat to the number of molecul in the gas (through the ideal gas law), not to it mass. this technic sens of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confus with the general sens of \"amount\" in the english language. the latter may refer to other measur such as mass or volume, rather than the number of particles. there are propos to replac \"amount of substance\" with more easily-distinguish terms, such as enplethi and stoichiometr amount.th iupac recommend that \"amount of substance\" should be use instead of \"number of moles\", just as the quantiti mass should not be call \"number of kilograms\". == natur of the particl == to avoid ambiguity, the natur of the particl should be specifi in ani measur of the amount of substance: thus, mol of molecul of oxygen is about grams, wherea mol of atom of oxygen (o) is about grams. == deriv quantiti == === molar quantiti (per mole) === the quotient of some extens physic quantiti of a homogen sampl by it amount of substanc is an intens properti of the substance, usual name by the prefix molar.for example, the ratio of the mass of a sampl by it amount of substanc is the molar mass, whose si unit is kilogram (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about g/mol for water, and g/mol for iron. from the volume, one get the molar volume, which is about milliliter/mol for liquid water and ml/mol for iron at room temperature. from the heat capacity, one get the molar heat capacity, which is about j/k/mol for water and about j/k/mol for iron. === amount concentr (mole per liter) === anoth import deriv quantiti is the amount of substanc concentr (also call amount concentration, or substanc concentr in clinic chemistry; which is defin as the amount of a specif substanc in a sampl of a solut (or some other mixture), divid by the volum of the sample. the si unit of this quantiti is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution). thus, for example, the amount concentr of sodium chlorid in ocean water is typic about mol/l. the denomin is the volum of the solution, not of the solvent. thus, for example, one liter of standard vodka contain about l of ethanol g, mol) and l of water. the amount concentr of ethanol is therefor mol of l of vodka) = mol/l, not mol of l of water), which would be mol/l. in chemistry, it is customari to read the unit \"mol/l\" as molar, and denot it by the symbol \"m\" (both follow the numer value). thus, for example, each liter of a molar\" or m\" solut of urea in water contain mole of that molecule. by extension, the amount concentr is also common call the molar of the substanc of interest in the solution. however, as of may these term and symbol are not condon by iupac.thi quantiti should not be confus with the mass concentration, which is the mass of the substanc of interest divid by the volum of the solut (about g/l for sodium chlorid in ocean water). === amount fraction (mole per mole) === confusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguish from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of mole (molecules) of the substanc of interest divid by the total number of mole (molecules) in the solut sample. this quantiti is more proper call the amount fraction. == histori == the alchemists, and especi the earli metallurgists, probabl had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviv record of ani general of the idea beyond a set of recipes. in mikhail lomonosov question the idea that mass was the onli measur of the quantiti of matter, but he did so onli in relat to his theori on gravitation. the develop of the concept of amount of substanc was coincident with, and vital to, the birth of

    "the viscos of a fluid is a measur of it resist to deform at a given rate for liquid it correspond to the inform concept of thick for exampl syrup has a higher viscos than water viscos can be conceptu as quantifi the intern friction forc that aris between adjac layer of fluid that are in relat motion for instanc when a viscous fluid is forc through a tube it flow more quick near the tube s axi than near it wall in such a case experi show that some stress such as a pressur differ between the two end of the tube is need to sustain the flow through the tube this is becaus a forc is requir to overcom the friction between the layer of the fluid which are in relat motion so for a tube with a constant rate of flow the strength of the compens forc is proport to the fluid s viscos a fluid that has no resist to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid zero viscos is observ onli at veri low temperatur in superfluid otherwis the second law of thermodynam requir all fluid to have posit viscos such fluid are technic said to be viscous or viscid a fluid with a high viscos such as pitch may appear to be a solid etymolog the word \"viscosity\" is deriv from the latin viscum (\"mistletoe\"). viscum also refer to a viscous glue deriv from mistleto berries. == definit == === simpl definit === in materi scienc and engineering, one is often interest in understand the forc or stress involv in the deform of a material. for instance, if the materi were a simpl spring, the answer would be given by hook law, which say that the forc experienc by a spring is proport to the distanc displac from equilibrium. stress which can be attribut to the deform of a materi from some rest state are call elast stresses. in other materials, stress are present which can be attribut to the rate of chang of the deform over time. these are call viscous stresses. for instance, in a fluid such as water the stress which aris from shear the fluid do not depend on the distanc the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how quick the shear occurs. viscos is the materi properti which relat the viscous stress in a materi to the rate of chang of a deform (the strain rate). although it appli to general flows, it is easi to visual and defin in a simpl shear flow, such as a planar couett flow. in the couett flow, a fluid is trap between two infinit larg plates, one fix and one in parallel motion at constant speed u {\\displaystyl u} (see illustr to the right). if the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steadi state the fluid particl move parallel to it, and their speed vari from {\\displaystyl at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. each layer of fluid move faster than the one just below it, and friction between them give rise to a forc resist their relat motion. in particular, the fluid appli on the top plate a forc in the direct opposit to it motion, and an equal but opposit forc on the bottom plate. an extern forc is therefor requir in order to keep the top plate move at constant speed. in mani fluids, the flow veloc is observ to vari linear from zero at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. moreover, the magnitud f {\\displaystyl f} of the forc act on the top plate is found to be proport to the speed u {\\displaystyl u} and the area a {\\displaystyl a} of each plate, and invers proport to their separ y {\\displaystyl y} : f = \u03bc a u y . {\\displaystyl f=\\mu a{\\frac {u}{y}}.} the proport factor \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is the dynam viscos of the fluid, with unit of pa \u22c5 s {\\displaystyl {\\text{pa}}\\cdot {\\text{s}}} (pascal-second), often simpli refer to as the viscosity. the ratio u / y {\\displaystyl u/y} is call the rate of shear deform or shear velocity, and is the deriv of the fluid speed in the direct perpendicular to the plate (see illustr to the right). if the veloc doe not vari linear with y {\\displaystyl y} , then the appropri general is: \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y , {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}},} where \u03c4 = f / a {\\displaystyl \\tau =f/a} , and \u2202 u / \u2202 y {\\displaystyl \\partial u/\\parti y} is the local shear velocity. this express is refer to as newton law of viscosity. in shear flow with planar symmetry, it is what defin \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is a special case of the general definit of viscos (see below), which can be express in coordinate-fre form. use of the greek letter mu ( \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } ) for the dynam viscos (sometim also call the absolut viscosity) is common among mechan and chemic engineers, as well as mathematician and physicists. however, the greek letter eta ( \u03b7 {\\displaystyl \\eta } ) is also use by chemists, physicists, and the iupac. the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is sometim also call the shear viscosity. however, at least one author discourag the use of this terminology, note that \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } can appear in nonshear flow in addit to shear flows. === general definit === in veri general terms, the viscous stress in a fluid are defin as those result from the relat veloc of differ fluid particles. as such, the viscous stress must depend on spatial gradient of the flow velocity. if the veloc gradient are small, then to a first approxim the viscous stress depend onli on the first deriv of the velocity. (for newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) in cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as \u03c4 i j = \u2211 k \u2211 \u2113 \u03bc i j k \u2113 \u2202 v k \u2202 r \u2113 , {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}=\\sum _{k}\\sum _{\\ell }\\mu _{ijk\\el }{\\frac {\\partial v_{k}}{\\partial r_{\\ell }}},} where \u03bc i j k \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijk\\el }} is a viscos tensor that map the veloc gradient tensor \u2202 v k / \u2202 r \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\partial v_{k}/\\partial r_{\\ell }} onto the viscous stress tensor \u03c4 i j {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}} . sinc the indic in this express can vari from to there are \"viscos coefficients\" \u03bc i j k l {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijkl}} in total. however, assum that the viscos tensor is isotrop reduc these coeffici to three independ paramet \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , \u03b2 {\\displaystyl \\beta } , \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\gamma } : \u03bc i j k \u2113 = \u03b1 \u03b4 i j \u03b4 k \u2113 + \u03b2 \u03b4 i k \u03b4 j \u2113 + \u03b3 \u03b4 i \u2113 \u03b4 j k , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijk\\el }=\\alpha \\delta _{ij}\\delta _{k\\ell }+\\beta \\delta _{ik}\\delta _{j\\ell }+\\gamma \\delta _{i\\el }\\delta _{jk},} and furthermore, it is assum that no viscous forc may aris when the fluid is undergo simpl rigid-bodi rotation, thus \u03b2 = \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\beta =\\gamma } , leav onli two independ parameters. the most usual decomposit is in term of the standard (scalar) viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } and the bulk viscos \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } such that \u03b1 = \u03ba \u2212 \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\alpha =\\kappa -{\\tfrac } and \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\beta =\\gamma =\\mu } . in vector notat this appear as: \u03c4 = \u03bc [ \u2207 v + ( \u2207 v ) \u2020 ] \u2212 ( \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba ) ( \u2207 \u22c5 v ) \u03b4 , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {\\tau } =\\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf {v} +(\\nabla \\mathbf {v} )^{\\dagger }\\right]-\\left({\\frac -\\kappa \\right)(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} )\\mathbf {\\delta } ,} where \u03b4 {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {\\delta } } is the unit tensor, and the dagger \u2020 {\\displaystyl \\dagger } denot the transpose. this equat can be thought of as a general form of newton law of viscosity. the bulk viscos (also call volum viscosity) express a type of intern friction that resist the shearless compress or expans of a fluid. knowledg of \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is frequent not necessari in fluid dynam problems. for example, an incompress fluid satisfi \u2207 \u22c5 v = {\\displaystyl \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} and so the term contain \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } drop out. moreover, \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is often assum to be neglig for gase sinc it is {\\displaystyl in a monatom ideal gas. one situat in which \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } can be import is the calcul of energi loss in sound and shock waves, describ by stoke law of sound attenuation, sinc these phenomena involv rapid expans and compressions. it is worth emphas that the abov express are not fundament law of nature, but rather definit of viscosity. as such, their util for ani given material, as well as mean for measur or calcul the viscosity, must be establish use separ means. === kinemat viscos === in fluid dynamics, it is sometim more conveni to work in term of the kinemat viscos (sometim also call the momentum diffusivity), defin as the ratio of the viscos \u03bc to the densiti of the fluid \u03c1. it is usual denot by the greek letter nu (\u03bd) and has dimens ( l e n g t h ) / t i m e {\\displaystyl \\mathrm } : \u03bd = \u03bc \u03c1 , {\\displaystyl \\nu ={\\frac {\\mu }{\\rho }},} in order to distinguish it from the dynam viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which has dimens f o r c e \u00d7 t i m e / a r e a {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {force\\tim time/area} } . == momentum transport == transport theori provid an altern interpret of viscos in term of momentum transport: viscos is the materi properti which character momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conduct character heat transport, and (mass) diffus character mass transport. to see this, note that in newton law of viscosity, \u03c4 = \u03bc ( \u2202 u / \u2202 y ) {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu (\\partial u/\\parti y)} , the shear stress \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } has unit equival to a momentum flux, i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. thus, \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } can be interpret as specifi the flow of momentum in the y {\\displaystyl y} direct from one fluid layer to the next. per newton law of viscosity, this momentum flow occur across a veloc gradient, and the magnitud of the correspond momentum flux is determin by the viscosity. the analog with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. just as heat flow from high temperatur to low temperatur and mass flow from high densiti to low density, momentum flow from high veloc to low velocity. these behavior are all describ by compact expressions, call constitut relations, whose one-dimension form are given here: j = \u2212 d \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202 x (fick law of diffusion) q = \u2212 k t \u2202 t \u2202 x (fourier law of heat conduction) \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y (newton law of viscosity) {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf {j} &=-d{\\frac {\\partial \\rho }{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fick law of {q} &=-k_{t}{\\frac {\\partial t}{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fouri law of heat &=\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}}&&{\\text{(newton law of viscosity)}}\\end{aligned}}} where \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } is the density, j {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {j} } and q {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {q} } are the mass and heat fluxes, and d {\\displaystyl d} and k t {\\displaystyl k_{t}} are the mass diffus and thermal conductivity. the fact that mass, momentum, and energi (heat) transport are among the most relev process in continuum mechan is not a coincidence: these are among the few physic quantiti that are conserv at the microscop level in interparticl collisions. thus, rather than be dictat by the fast and complex microscop interact timescale, their dynam occur on macroscop timescales, as describ by the various equat of transport theori and hydrodynamics. == newtonian and non-newtonian fluid == newton law of viscos is not a fundament law of nature, but rather a constitut equat (like hook law, fick law, and ohm law) which serv to defin the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it form is motiv by experi which show that for a wide rang of fluids, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is independ of strain rate. such fluid are call newtonian. gases, water, and mani common liquid can be consid newtonian in ordinari condit and contexts. however, there are mani non-newtonian fluid that signific deviat from this behavior. for example: shear-thicken liquids, whose viscos increas with the rate of shear strain. shear-thin liquids, whose viscos decreas with the rate of shear strain. thixotrop liquids, that becom less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. rheopect (dilatant) liquids, that becom more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. bingham plastic that behav as a solid at low stress but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.trouton ratio is the ratio of extension viscos to shear viscosity. for a newtonian fluid, the trouton ratio is shear-thin liquid are veri commonly, but misleadingly, describ as thixotropic.even for a newtonian fluid, the viscos usual depend on it composit and temperature. for gase and other compress fluids, it depend on temperatur and vari veri slowli with pressure. the viscos of some fluid may depend on other factors. a magnetorheolog fluid, for example, becom thicker when subject to a magnet field, possibl to the point of behav like a solid. == in solid == the viscous forc that aris dure fluid flow must not be confus with the elast forc that aris in a solid in respons to shear, compress or extens stresses. while in the latter the stress is proport to the amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proport to the rate of deform over time. for this reason, maxwel use the term fugit elast for fluid viscosity. however, mani liquid (includ water) will briefli react like elast solid when subject to sudden stress. conversely, mani \"solids\" (even granite) will flow like liquids, albeit veri slowly, even under arbitrarili small stress. such materi are therefor best describ as possess both elast (reaction to deformation) and viscos (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, be viscoelastic. viscoelast solid may exhibit both shear viscos and bulk viscosity. the extension viscos is a linear combin of the shear and bulk viscos that describ the reaction of a solid elast materi to elongation. it is wide use for character polymers. in geology, earth materi that exhibit viscous deform at least three order of magnitud greater than their elast deform are sometim call rheids. == measur == viscos is measur with various type of viscomet and rheometers. a rheomet is use for fluid that cannot be defin by a singl valu of viscos and therefor requir more paramet to be set and measur than is the case for a viscometer. close temperatur control of the fluid is essenti to obtain accur measurements, particular in materi like lubricants, whose viscos can doubl with a chang of onli \u00b0c.for some fluids, the viscos is constant over a wide rang of shear rate (newtonian fluids). the fluid without a constant viscos (non-newtonian fluids) cannot be describ by a singl number. non-newtonian fluid exhibit a varieti of differ correl between shear stress and shear rate. one of the most common instrument for measur kinemat viscos is the glass capillari viscometer. in coat industries, viscos may be measur with a cup in which the efflux time is measured. there are sever sort of cup \u2013 such as the zahn cup and the ford viscos cup \u2013 with the usag of each type vari main accord to the industry. the efflux time can also be convert to kinemat viscos (centistokes, cst) through the convers equations. also use in coatings, a stormer viscomet use load-bas rotat in order to determin viscosity. the viscos is report in kreb unit (ku), which are uniqu to stormer viscometers. vibrat viscomet can also be use to measur viscosity. resonant, or vibrat viscomet work by creat shear wave within the liquid. in this method, the sensor is submerg in the fluid and is made to reson at a specif frequency. as the surfac of the sensor shear through the liquid, energi is lost due to it viscosity. this dissip energi is then measur and convert into a viscos reading. a higher viscos caus a greater loss of energy.extension viscos can be measur with various rheomet that appli extension stress. volum viscos can be measur with an acoust rheometer. appar viscos is a calcul deriv from test perform on drill fluid use in oil or gas well development. these calcul and test help engin develop and maintain the properti of the drill fluid to the specif required. nanoviscos (viscos sens by nanoprobes) can be measur by fluoresc correl spectroscopy. == unit == the si unit of dynam viscos is the newton-second per squar meter also frequent express in the equival form pascal-second (pa\u00b7s) and kilogram per meter per second the cgs unit is the pois (p, or = pa\u00b7s), name after jean l\u00e9onard mari poiseuille. it is common expressed, particular in astm standards, as centipois (cp), becaus it is more conveni (for instanc the viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cp), and one centipois is equal to the si millipasc second (mpa\u00b7s). the si unit of kinemat viscos is squar meter per second wherea the cgs unit for kinemat viscos is the stoke (st, or = name after sir georg gabriel stokes. in u.s. usage, stoke is sometim use as the singular form. the submultipl centistok (cst) is often use instead, cst = = the kinemat viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cst. the most frequent use system of us customary, or imperial, unit are the british gravit (bg) and english engin (ee). in the bg system, dynam viscos has unit of pound-second per squar foot and in the ee system it has unit of pound-force-second per squar foot note that the pound and pound-forc are equivalent; the two system differ onli in how forc and mass are defined. in the bg system the pound is a basic unit from which the unit of mass (the slug) is defin by newton second law, wherea in the ee system the unit of forc and mass (the pound-forc and pound-mass respectively) are defin independ through the second law use the proport constant gc. kinemat viscos has unit of squar feet per second in both the bg and ee systems. nonstandard unit includ the reyn, a british unit of dynam viscosity. in the automot industri the viscos index is use to describ the chang of viscos with temperature. the reciproc of viscos is fluidity, usual symbol by \u03d5 = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\phi } or f = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl } , depend on the convent used, measur in reciproc pois or sometim call the rhe. fluiditi is seldom use in engin practice. at one time the petroleum industri reli on measur kinemat viscos by mean of the saybolt viscometer, and express kinemat viscos in unit of saybolt univers second (sus). other abbrevi such as ssu (saybolt second universal) or suv (saybolt univers viscosity) are sometim used. kinemat viscos in centistok can be convert from sus accord to the arithmet and the refer tabl provid in astm d == molecular origin == in general, the viscos of a system depend in detail on how the molecul constitut the system interact. there are no simpl but correct express for the viscos of a fluid. the simplest exact express are the green\u2013kubo relat for the linear shear viscos or the transient time correl function express deriv by evan and morriss in although these express are each exact, calcul the viscos of a dens fluid use these relat current requir the use of molecular dynam comput simulations. on the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilut gas. even elementari assumpt about how gas molecul move and interact lead to a basic understand of the molecular origin of viscosity. more sophist treatment can be construct by systemat coarse-grain the equat of motion of the gas molecules. an exampl of such a treatment is chapman\u2013enskog theory, which deriv express for the viscos of a dilut gas from the boltzmann equation.momentum transport in gase is general mediat by discret molecular collisions, and in liquid by attract forc which bind molecul close together. becaus of this, the dynam viscos of liquid are typic much larger than those of gases. === pure gase === viscos in gase aris princip from the molecular diffus that transport momentum between layer of flow. an elementari calcul for a dilut gas at temperatur t {\\displaystyl t} and densiti \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c1 \u03bb k b t \u03c0 m , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\alpha \\rho \\lambda {\\sqrt {\\frac m}}},} where k b {\\displaystyl k_{\\text{b}}} is the boltzmann constant, m {\\displaystyl m} the molecular mass, and \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } a numer constant on the order of {\\displaystyl . the quantiti \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } , the mean free path, measur the averag distanc a molecul travel between collisions. even without a priori knowledg of \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , this express has interest implications. in particular, sinc \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is typic invers proport to densiti and increas with temperature, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } itself should increas with temperatur and be independ of densiti at fix temperature. in fact, both of these predict persist in more sophist treatments, and accur describ experiment observations. note that this behavior run counter to common intuit regard liquids, for which viscos typic decreas with temperature.for rigid elast sphere of diamet \u03c3 {\\displaystyl \\sigma } , \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } can be computed, give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c0 / k b m t \u03c3 . {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {\\alpha }{\\pi {\\sqrt {k_{\\text{b}}mt}}{\\sigma in this case \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is independ of temperature, so \u03bc \u221d t / {\\displaystyl \\mu \\propto . for more complic molecular models, however, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } depend on temperatur in a non-trivi way, and simpl kinet argument as use here are inadequate. more fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becom imprecis for particl that interact over a finit range, which limit the use of the concept for describ real-world gases. ==== chapman\u2013enskog theori ==== a techniqu develop by sydney chapman and david enskog in the earli allow a more refin calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is base on the boltzmann equation, which provid a systemat statist descript of a dilut gas in term of intermolecular interactions. as such, their techniqu allow accur calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } for more realist molecular models, such as those incorpor intermolecular attract rather than just hard-cor repulsion. it turn out that a more realist model of interact is essenti for accur predict of the temperatur depend of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which experi show increas more rapid than the t / {\\displaystyl trend predict for rigid elast spheres. indeed, the chapman\u2013enskog analysi show that the predict temperatur depend can be tune by vari the paramet in various molecular models. a simpl exampl is the sutherland model, which describ rigid elast sphere with weak mutual attraction. in such a case, the attract forc can be treat perturbatively, which lead to a particular simpl express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } : \u03bc = \u03c3 ( k b m t \u03c0 ) / ( + s t ) \u2212 , {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {k_{\\text{b}}mt}{\\pi where s {\\displaystyl s} is independ of temperature, be determin onli by the paramet of the intermolecular attraction. to connect with experiment, it is conveni to rewrit as \u03bc = \u03bc ( t t ) / t + s t + s , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\mu where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos at temperatur t {\\displaystyl . if \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is known from experi at t = t {\\displaystyl and at least one other temperature, then s {\\displaystyl s} can be calculated. it turn out that express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } obtain in this way are accur for a number of gase over a sizabl rang of temperatures. on the other hand, chapman & cowl argu that this success doe not impli that molecul actual interact accord to the sutherland model. rather, they interpret the predict for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } as a simpl interpol which is valid for some gase over fix rang of temperature, but otherwis doe not provid a pictur of intermolecular interact which is fundament correct and general. slight more sophist models, such as the lennard-jon potential, may provid a better picture, but onli at the cost of a more opaqu depend on temperature. in some system the assumpt of spheric symmetri must be abandon as well, as is the case for vapor with high polar molecul like ==== bulk viscos ==== in the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscos aris in gase whenev there are non-neglig relax timescal govern the exchang of energi between the translat energi of molecul and their intern energy, e.g. rotat and vibrational. as such, the bulk viscos is {\\displaystyl for a monatom ideal gas, in which the intern energi of molecul in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide, whose molecul possess both rotat and vibrat energy. === pure liquid === in contrast with gases, there is no simpl yet accur pictur for the molecular origin of viscos in liquids. at the simplest level of description, the relat motion of adjac layer in a liquid is oppos primarili by attract molecular forc act across the layer boundary. in this picture, one (correctly) expect viscos to decreas with increas temperature. this is becaus increas temperatur increas the random thermal motion of the molecules, which make it easier for them to overcom their attract interactions.build on this visualization, a simpl theori can be construct in analog with the discret structur of a solid: group of molecul in a liquid are visual as form \"cages\" which surround and enclos singl molecules. these cage can be occupi or unoccupied, and stronger molecular attract correspond to stronger cages. due to random thermal motion, a molecul \"hops\" between cage at a rate which vari invers with the strength of molecular attractions. in equilibrium these \"hops\" are not bias in ani direction. on the other hand, in order for two adjac layer to move relat to each other, the \"hops\" must be bias in the direct of the relat motion. the forc requir to sustain this direct motion can be estim for a given shear rate, lead to where n a {\\displaystyl n_{a}} is the avogadro constant, h {\\displaystyl h} is the planck constant, v {\\displaystyl v} is the volum of a mole of liquid, and t b {\\displaystyl t_{b}} is the normal boil point. this result has the same form as the widespread and accur empir relat where a {\\displaystyl a} and b {\\displaystyl b} are constant fit from data. on the other hand, sever author express caution with respect to this model. error as larg as can be encount use equat compar with fit equat to experiment data. more fundamentally, the physic assumpt under equat have been criticized. it has also been argu that the exponenti depend in equat doe not necessarili describ experiment observ more accur than simpler, non-exponenti expressions.in light of these shortcomings, the develop of a less ad hoc model is a matter of practic interest. forego simplic in favor of precision, it is possibl to write rigor express for viscos start from the fundament equat of motion for molecules. a classic exampl of this approach is irving\u2013kirkwood theory. on the other hand, such express are given as averag over multiparticl correl function and are therefor difficult to appli in practice. in general, empir deriv express (base on exist viscos measurements) appear to be the onli consist reliabl mean of calcul viscos in liquids. === mixtur and blend === ==== gaseous mixtur ==== the same molecular-kinet pictur of a singl compon gas can also be appli to a gaseous mixture. for instance, in the chapman\u2013enskog approach the viscos \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} of a binari mixtur of gase can be written in term of the individu compon viscos \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu , their respect volum fractions, and the intermolecular interactions. as for the single-compon gas, the depend of \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} on the paramet of the intermolecular interact enter through various collision integr which may not be express in term of elementari functions. to obtain usabl express for \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} which reason match experiment data, the collision integr typic must be evalu use some combin of analyt calcul and empir fitting. an exampl of such a procedur is the sutherland approach for the single-compon gas, discuss above. ==== blend of liquid ==== as for pure liquids, the viscos of a blend of liquid is difficult to predict from molecular principles. one method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theori present abov for a pure liquid. this can be done with vari level of sophistication. one use express result from such an analysi is the lederer\u2013roegi equat for a binari mixture: ln \u2061 \u03bc blend = x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc + \u03b1 x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\ln \\mu _{\\text{blend}}={\\frac \\mu {\\alpha \\mu where \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } is an empir parameter, and x , {\\displaystyl and \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu are the respect mole fraction and viscos of the compon liquids.sinc blend is an import process in the lubric and oil industries, a varieti of empir and proprieti equat exist for predict the viscos of a blend, besid those stem direct from molecular theory. === solut and suspens === ==== aqeuous solut ==== depend on the solut and rang of concentration, an aqueous electrolyt solut can have either a larger or smaller viscos compar with pure water at the same temperatur and pressure. for instance, a salin (sodium chloride) solut has viscos over time that of pure water, wherea a potassium iodid solut has viscos about time that of pure water. an ideal model of dilut electrolyt solut lead to the follow predict for the viscos \u03bc s {\\displaystyl \\mu _{s}} of a solution: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu {c}},} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the solvent, c {\\displaystyl c} is the concentration, and a {\\displaystyl a} is a posit constant which depend on both solvent and solut properties. however, this express is onli valid for veri dilut solutions, have c {\\displaystyl c} less than mol/l. for higher concentrations, addit term are necessari which account for higher-ord molecular correlations: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c + b c + c c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu where b {\\displaystyl b} and c {\\displaystyl c} are fit from data. in particular, a negat valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is abl to account for the decreas in viscos observ in some solutions. estim valu of these constant are shown below for sodium chlorid and potassium iodid at temperatur \u00b0c (mol = mole, l = liter). ==== suspens ==== in a suspens of solid particl (e.g. micron-s sphere suspend in oil), an effect viscos \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be defin in term of stress and strain compon which are averag over a volum larg compar with the distanc between the suspend particles, but small with respect to macroscop dimensions. such suspens general exhibit non-newtonian behavior. however, for dilut system in steadi flows, the behavior is newtonian and express for \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be deriv direct from the particl dynamics. in a veri dilut system, with volum fraction \u03d5 \u2272 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\lesssim , interact between the suspend particl can be ignored. in such a case one can explicit calcul the flow field around each particl independently, and combin the result to obtain \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} . for spheres, this result in the einstein equation: \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the suspend liquid. the linear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is a direct consequ of neglect interparticl interactions; in general, one will have \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where the coeffici b {\\displaystyl b} may depend on the particl shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks). experiment determin of the precis valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is difficult, however: even the predict b = / {\\displaystyl for sphere has not been conclus validated, with various experi find valu in the rang \u2272 b \u2272 {\\displaystyl b\\lesssim . this defici has been attribut to difficulti in control experiment conditions.in denser suspensions, \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} acquir a nonlinear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } , which indic the import of interparticl interactions. various analyt and semi-empir scheme exist for captur this regime. at the most basic level, a term quadrat in \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is ad to \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} : \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu and the coeffici b {\\displaystyl is fit from experiment data or approxim from the microscop theory. in general, however, one should be cautious in appli such simpl formula sinc non-newtonian behavior appear in dens suspens ( \u03d5 \u2273 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\gtrsim for spheres), or in suspens of elong or flexibl particles.ther is a distinct between a suspens of solid particles, describ above, and an emulsion. the latter is a suspens of tini droplets, which themselv may exhibit intern circulation. the presenc of intern circul can notic decreas the observ effect viscosity, and differ theoret or semi-empir model must be used. === amorph materi === in the high and low temperatur limits, viscous flow in amorph materi (e.g. in glass and melts) has the arrhenius form: \u03bc = a e q / ( r t ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu =ae^{q/(rt)},} where q is a relev activ energy, given in term of molecular parameters; t is temperature; r is the molar gas constant; and a is approxim a constant. the activ energi q take a differ valu depend on whether the high or low temperatur limit is be considered: it chang from a high valu qh at low temperatur (in the glassi state) to a low valu ql at high temperatur (in the liquid state). for intermedi temperatures, q {\\displaystyl q} vari nontrivi with temperatur and the simpl arrhenius form fails. on the other hand, the two-exponenti equat \u03bc = a t exp \u2061 ( b r t ) [ + c exp \u2061 ( d r t ) ] , {\\displaystyl \\mu =at\\exp \\left({\\frac \\left({\\frac {d}{rt}}\\right)\\right],} where a {\\displaystyl a} , b {\\displaystyl b} , c {\\displaystyl c} , d {\\displaystyl d} are all constants, provid a good fit to experiment data over the entir rang of temperatures, while at the same time reduc to the correct arrhenius form in the low and high temperatur limits. besid be a conveni fit to data, the express can also be deriv from various theoret model of amorph materi at the atom level.a two-exponenti equat for the viscos can be deriv within the dyre shove model of supercool liquids, where the arrhenius energi barrier is identifi with the high-frequ shear modulus time a characterist shove volume. upon specifi the temperatur depend of the shear modulus via thermal expans and via the repuls part of the intermolecular potential, anoth two-exponenti equat is retrieved: \u03bc = exp \u2061 { v c c g k b t exp \u2061 [ ( + \u03bb ) \u03b1 t t g ( \u2212 t t g ) ] } {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\exp {\\left\\{{\\frac {v_{c}c_{g}}{k_{b}t}}\\exp )\\alpha {t}{t_{g}}}\\right)\\right]}\\right\\}}} where c g {\\displaystyl c_{g}} denot the high-frequ shear modulus of the materi evalu at a temperatur equal to the glass transit temperatur t g {\\displaystyl t_{g}} , v c {\\displaystyl v_{c}} is the so-cal shove volume, i.e. it is the characterist volum of the group of atom involv in the shove event by which an atom/molecul escap from the cage of nearest-neighbours, typic on the order of the volum occupi by few atoms. furthermore, \u03b1 t {\\displaystyl \\alpha _{t}} is the thermal expans coeffici of the material, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is a paramet which measur the steep of the power-law rise of the ascend flank of the first peak of the radial distribut function, and is quantit relat to the repuls part of the interatom potential. finally, k b {\\displaystyl k_{b}} denot the boltzmann constant. === eddi viscos === in the studi of turbul in fluids, a common practic strategi is to ignor the small-scal vortic (or eddies) in the motion and to calcul a large-scal motion with an effect viscosity, call the \"eddi viscosity\", which character the transport and dissip of energi in the smaller-scal flow (see larg eddi simulation). in contrast to the viscos of the fluid itself, which must be posit by the second law of thermodynamics, the eddi viscos can be negative. == select substanc == observ valu of viscos vari over sever order of magnitude, even for common substanc (see the order of magnitud tabl below). for instance, a sucros (sugar) solut has a viscos over time that of water, and time that of air. more dramatically, pitch has been estim to have a viscos billion time that of water. === water === the dynam viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } of water is about mpa\u00b7 at room temperatur \u00b0c). as a function of temperatur in kelvins, the viscos can be estim use the semi-empir vogel-fulcher-tammann equation: \u03bc = a exp \u2061 ( b t \u2212 c ) {\\displaystyl \\mu =a\\exp \\left({\\frac {b}{t-c}}\\right)} where a = mpa\u00b7s, b = k, and c = k. experiment determin valu of the viscos are also given in the tabl below. note that at \u00b0c the dynam viscos is about cp and the kinemat viscos is about cst. === air === under standard atmospher condit \u00b0c and pressur of bar), the dynam viscos of air is \u03bcpa\u00b7s, rough time smaller than the viscos of water at the same temperature. except at veri high pressure, the viscos of air depend most on the temperature. among the mani possibl approxim formula for the temperatur depend (see temperatur depend of viscosity), one is: \u03b7 air = \u22c5 \u2212 \u22c5 t {\\displaystyl \\eta which is accur in the rang \u00b0c to \u00b0c. for this formula to be valid, the temperatur must be given in kelvins; \u03b7 air {\\displaystyl \\eta _{\\text{air}}} then correspond to the viscos in pa\u00b7s. === other common substanc === === order of magnitud estim === the follow tabl illustr the rang of viscos valu observ in common substances. unless otherwis noted, a temperatur of \u00b0c and a pressur of atmospher are assumed. certain substanc of variabl composit or with non-newtonian

defin terminolog == jame thomson, the brother of lord kelvin, introduc the term torqu into english scientif literatur in however, torqu is refer to use differ vocabulari depend on geograph locat and field of study. this articl follow the definit use in us physic in it usag of the word torque. in the uk and in us mechan engineering, torqu is refer to as moment of force, usual shorten to moment. these term are interchang in us physic and uk physic terminology, unlik in us mechan engineering, where the term torqu is use for the close relat \"result moment of a couple\". === torqu and moment in the us mechan engin terminolog === in us mechan engineering, torqu is defin mathemat as the rate of chang of angular momentum of an object (in physic it is call \"net torque\"). the definit of torqu state that one or both of the angular veloc or the moment of inertia of an object are changing. moment is the general term use for the tendenc of one or more appli forc to rotat an object about an axis, but not necessarili to chang the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is call torqu in physics). for example, a rotat forc appli to a shaft caus acceleration, such as a drill bit acceler from rest, result in a moment call a torque. by contrast, a later forc on a beam produc a moment (call a bend moment), but sinc the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bend moment is not call a torque. similar with ani forc coupl on an object that has no chang to it angular momentum, such moment is also not call a torque. == definit and relat to angular momentum == a forc appli perpendicular to a lever multipli by it distanc from the lever fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is it torque. a forc of three newton appli two meter from the fulcrum, for example, exert the same torqu as a forc of one newton appli six metr from the fulcrum. the direct of the torqu can be determin by use the right hand grip rule: if the finger of the right hand are curl from the direct of the lever arm to the direct of the force, then the thumb point in the direct of the torque.mor generally, the torqu on a point particl (which has the posit r in some refer frame) can be defin as the cross product: \u03c4 = r \u00d7 f , {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}=\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} ,} where r is the particl posit vector relat to the fulcrum, and f is the forc act on the particle. the magnitud \u03c4 of the torqu is given by \u03c4 = r f sin \u2061 \u03b8 , {\\displaystyl \\tau =rf\\sin \\theta ,\\!} where r is the distanc from the axi of rotat to the particle, f is the magnitud of the forc applied, and \u03b8 is the angl between the posit and forc vectors. alternatively, \u03c4 = r f \u22a5 , {\\displaystyl \\tau =rf_{\\perp },} where f\u22a5 is the amount of forc direct perpendicular to the posit of the particle. ani forc direct parallel to the particl posit vector doe not produc a torque.it follow from the properti of the cross product that the torqu vector is perpendicular to both the posit and forc vectors. conversely, the torqu vector defin the plane in which the posit and forc vector lie. the result torqu vector direct is determin by the right-hand rule.th net torqu on a bodi determin the rate of chang of the bodi angular momentum, \u03c4 = d l d t {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}} where l is the angular momentum vector and t is time. for the motion of a point particle, l = i \u03c9 , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {l} =i{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }},} where i is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the orbit angular veloc pseudovector. it follow that \u03c4 n e t = d l d t = d ( i \u03c9 ) d t = i d \u03c9 d t + d i d t \u03c9 = i \u03b1 + d ( m r ) d t \u03c9 = i \u03b1 + r p | | \u03c9 , {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}_{\\mathrm {net} }={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} (i{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }})}{\\mathrm {d} t}}=i{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}+{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} i}{\\mathrm {d} t}}{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}=i{\\boldsymbol {\\alpha }}+{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {d} t}}{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}=i{\\boldsymbol {\\alpha {\\omega }},} where \u03b1 is the angular acceler of the particle, and p|| is the radial compon of it linear momentum. this equat is the rotat analogu of newton second law for point particles, and is valid for ani type of trajectory. note that although forc and acceler are alway parallel and direct proportional, the torqu \u03c4 need not be parallel or direct proport to the angular acceler \u03b1. this aris from the fact that although mass is alway conserved, the moment of inertia in general is not. === proof of the equival of definit === the definit of angular momentum for a singl point particl is: l = r \u00d7 p {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {l} =\\mathbf {r} \\time {\\boldsymbol {p}}} where p is the particl linear momentum and r is the posit vector from the origin. the time-deriv of this is: d l d t = r \u00d7 d p d t + d r d t \u00d7 p . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {r} \\time {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {p}}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}+{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {r} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}\\time {\\boldsymbol {p}}.} this result can easili be proven by split the vector into compon and appli the product rule. now use the definit of forc f = d p d t {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {f} ={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {p}}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}} (whether or not mass is constant) and the definit of veloc d r d t = v {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {r} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {v} } d l d t = r \u00d7 f + v \u00d7 p . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} +\\mathbf {v} \\time {\\boldsymbol {p}}.} the cross product of momentum p {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {p}}} with it associ veloc v {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {v} } is zero becaus veloc and momentum are parallel, so the second term vanishes. by definition, torqu \u03c4 = r \u00d7 f. therefore, torqu on a particl is equal to the first deriv of it angular momentum with respect to time. if multipl forc are applied, newton second law instead read fnet = ma, and it follow that d l d t = r \u00d7 f n e t = \u03c4 n e t . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} _{\\mathrm {net} }={\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}_{\\mathrm {net} }.} this is a general proof for point particles. the proof can be general to a system of point particl by appli the abov proof to each of the point particl and then sum over all the point particles. similarly, the proof can be general to a continu mass by appli the abov proof to each point within the mass, and then integr over the entir mass. == unit == torqu has the dimens of forc time distance, symbol although those fundament dimens are the same as that for energi or work, offici si literatur suggest use the unit newton metr (n\u22c5m) and never the joule. the unit newton metr is proper denot n\u22c5m.the tradit imperi and u.s. customari unit for torqu are the pound foot (lbf-ft), or for small valu the pound inch (lbf-in). confusingly, in us practic torqu is most common refer to as the foot-pound (denot as either lb-ft or ft-lb) and the inch-pound (denot as in-lb). practition depend on context and the hyphen in the abbrevi to know that these refer to torqu and not to energi or moment of mass (as the symbol ft-lb would proper imply). == special case and other fact == === moment arm formula === a veri use special case, often given as the definit of torqu in field other than physics, is as follows: \u03c4 = ( moment arm ) ( forc ) . {\\displaystyl \\tau =({\\text{moment arm}})({\\text{force}}).} the construct of the \"moment arm\" is shown in the figur to the right, along with the vector r and f mention above. the problem with this definit is that it doe not give the direct of the torqu but onli the magnitude, and henc it is difficult to use in three-dimension cases. if the forc is perpendicular to the displac vector r, the moment arm will be equal to the distanc to the centre, and torqu will be a maximum for the given force. the equat for the magnitud of a torque, aris from a perpendicular force: \u03c4 = ( distanc to centr ) ( forc ) . {\\displaystyl \\tau =({\\text{dist to centre}})({\\text{force}}).} for example, if a person place a forc of n at the termin end of a wrench that is m long (or a forc of n exact m from the twist point of a wrench of ani length), the torqu will be n\u22c5m \u2013 assum that the person move the wrench by appli forc in the plane of movement and perpendicular to the wrench. === static equilibrium === for an object to be in static equilibrium, not onli must the sum of the forc be zero, but also the sum of the torqu (moments) about ani point. for a two-dimension situat with horizont and vertic forces, the sum of the forc requir is two equations: \u03c3h = and \u03c3v = and the torqu a third equation: \u03c3\u03c4 = that is, to solv static determin equilibrium problem in two-dimensions, three equat are used. === net forc versus torqu === when the net forc on the system is zero, the torqu measur from ani point in space is the same. for example, the torqu on a

of the axis. internal-combust engin produc use torqu onli over a limit rang of rotat speed (typic from around rpm for a small car). one can measur the vari torqu output over that rang with a dynamometer, and show it as a torqu curve. steam engin and electr motor tend to produc maximum torqu close to zero rpm, with the torqu diminish as rotat speed rise (due to increas friction and other constraints). reciproc steam-engin and electr motor can start heavi load from zero rpm without a clutch. == relationship between torque, power, and energi == if a forc is allow to act through a

the scalar product. algebraically, the equat may be rearrang to comput torqu for a given angular speed and power output. note that the power inject by the torqu depend onli on the instantan angular speed \u2013 not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remain constant while the torqu is be appli (this is equival to the linear case where the power inject by a forc depend onli on the instantan speed \u2013 not on the result acceleration, if any). in practice, this relationship can be observ in bicycles: bicycl are typic compos of two road wheels, front and rear gear (refer to as sprockets) mesh with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechan if the bicycl transmiss system allow multipl gear ratio to be use (i.e. multi-spe bicycle), all of which attach to the frame. a cyclist, the person who ride the bicycle, provid the input power by turn pedals, therebi crank the front sprocket (common refer to as chainring). the input power provid by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadenc (i.e. the number of pedal revolut per minute) and the torqu on spindl of the bicycl crankset. the bicycl drivetrain transmit the input power to the road wheel, which in turn convey the receiv power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. depend on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is convert to a (torque, rpm)output pair. by use a larger rear gear, or by switch to a lower gear in multi-spe bicycles, angular speed of the road wheel is decreas while the torqu is increased, product of which (i.e. power) doe not change. consist unit must be used. for metric si units, power is watts, torqu is newton metr and angular speed is radian per second (not rpm and not revolut per second). also, the unit newton metr is dimension equival to the joule, which is the unit of energy. however, in the case of torque, the unit is assign to a vector, wherea for energy, it is assign to a scalar. this mean that the dimension equival of the newton metr and the joul may be appli in the former, but not in the latter case. this problem is address in orient analysi which treat radian as a base unit rather than a dimensionless unit. === convers to other unit === a convers factor may be necessari when use differ unit of power or torque. for example, if rotat speed (revolut per time) is use in place of angular speed (radian per time), we multipli by a factor of radian per revolution. in the follow formulas, p is power, \u03c4 is torque, and \u03bd (greek letter nu) is rotat speed. p = \u03c4 \u22c5 \u03c0 \u22c5 \u03bd {\\displaystyl p=\\tau \\cdot \\cdot \\nu } show units: p ( w ) = \u03c4 ( n \u22c5 m ) \u22c5 \u03c0 ( r a d / r e v ) \u22c5 \u03bd ( r e v / s e c ) {\\displaystyl p({\\rm {w}})=\\tau {\\rm {(n\\cdot m)}}\\cdot {\\rm {(rad/rev)}}\\cdot \\nu {\\rm {(rev/sec)}}} divid by second per minut give us the following. p ( w ) = \u03c4 ( n \u22c5 m ) \u22c5 \u03c0 ( r a d / r e v ) \u22c5 \u03bd ( r p m ) {\\displaystyl p({\\rm {w}})={\\frac {\\tau {\\rm {(n\\cdot m)}}\\cdot {\\rm {(rad/rev)}}\\cdot \\nu {\\rm where rotat speed is in revolut per minut (rpm). some peopl (e.g., american automot engineers) use horsepow (mechanical) for power, foot-pound (lbf\u22c5ft) for torqu and rpm for rotat speed. this result in the formula chang to: p ( h p ) = \u03c4 ( l b f \u22c5 f t ) \u22c5 \u03c0 ( r a d / r e v ) \u22c5 \u03bd ( r p m ) , . {\\displaystyl p({\\rm {hp}})={\\frac {\\tau {\\rm {(lbf\\cdot ft)}}\\cdot {\\rm {(rad/rev)}}\\cdot \\nu ({\\rm the constant below (in foot-pound per minute) chang with the definit of the horsepower; for example, use metric horsepower, it becom approxim the use of other unit (e.g., btu per hour for power) would requir a differ custom convers factor. === deriv === for a rotat object, the linear distanc cover at the circumfer of rotat is the product of the radius with the angl covered. that is: linear distanc = radius \u00d7 angular distance. and by definition, linear distanc = linear speed \u00d7 time = radius \u00d7 angular speed \u00d7 time. by the definit of torque: torqu = radius \u00d7 force. we can rearrang this to determin forc = torqu \u00f7 radius. these two valu can be substitut into the definit of power: power = forc \u22c5 linear distanc time = ( torqu r ) \u22c5 ( r \u22c5 angular speed \u22c5 t ) t = torqu \u22c5 angular speed . {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{power}}&={\\frac {{\\text{force}}\\cdot {\\text{linear {\\left({\\dfrac {\\text{torque}}{r}}\\right)\\cdot (r\\cdot {\\text{angular speed}}\\cdot {\\text{angular speed}}.\\end{aligned}}} the radius r and time t have drop out of the equation. however, angular speed must be in radian per unit of time, by the assum direct relationship between linear speed and angular speed at the begin of the derivation. if the rotat speed is measur in revolut per unit of time, the linear speed and distanc are increas proportion by in the abov deriv to give: power = torqu \u22c5 \u03c0 \u22c5 rotat speed . {\\displaystyl {\\text{power}}={\\text{torque}}\\cdot \\cdot {\\text{rot speed}}.\\,} if torqu is in newton metr and rotat speed in revolut per second, the abov equat give power in newton metr per second or watts. if imperi unit are used, and if torqu is in pounds-forc feet and rotat speed in revolut per minute, the abov equat give power in foot pounds-forc per minute. the horsepow form of the equat is then deriv by appli the convers factor ft\u22c5lbf/min per horsepower: power = torqu \u22c5 \u03c0 \u22c5 rotat speed \u22c5 ft \u22c5 lbf min \u22c5 horsepow , \u22c5 ft \u22c5 lbf min \u2248 torqu \u22c5 rpm , {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{power}}&={\\text{torque}}\\cdot \\cdot {\\text{rot speed}}\\cdot {\\frac {{\\text{ft}}\\cdot

moments, also known as varignon theorem (not to be confus with the geometr theorem of the same name) state that the sum of torqu due to sever forc appli to a singl point is equal to the torqu due to the sum (resultant) of the forces. mathematically, this follow from: ( r \u00d7 f ) + ( r \u00d7 f ) + \u22ef = r \u00d7 ( f + f + \u22ef ) . {\\displaystyl (\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} {r}

    "the densiti more precis the volumetr mass densiti also known as specif mass of a substanc is it mass per unit volum the symbol most often use for densiti is \u03c1 the lower case greek letter rho although the latin letter d can also be use mathemat densiti is defin as mass divid by volum \u03c1 m v displaystyl rho frac m v where \u03c1 is the densiti m is the mass and v is the volum in some case for instanc in the unit state oil and gas industri densiti is loos defin as it weight per unit volume, although this is scientif inaccur \u2013 this quantiti is more specif call specif weight. for a pure substanc the densiti has the same numer valu as it mass concentration. differ materi usual have differ densities, and densiti may be relev to buoyancy, puriti and packaging. osmium and iridium are the densest known element at standard condit for temperatur and pressure. to simplifi comparison of densiti across differ system of units, it is sometim replac by the dimensionless quantiti \"relat density\" or \"specif gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the densiti of the materi to that of a standard material, usual water. thus a relat densiti less than one relat to water mean that the substanc float in water. the densiti of a materi vari with temperatur and pressure. this variat is typic small for solid and liquid but much greater for gases. increas the pressur on an object decreas the volum of the object and thus increas it density. increas the temperatur of a substanc (with a few exceptions) decreas it densiti by increas it volume. in most materials, heat the bottom of a fluid result in convect of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decreas in the densiti of the heat fluid. this caus it to rise relat to more dens unheat material. the reciproc of the densiti of a substanc is occasion call it specif volume, a term sometim use in thermodynamics. densiti is an intens properti in that increas the amount of a substanc doe not increas it density; rather it increas it mass. == histori == in a well-known but probabl apocryph tale, archimed was given the task of determin whether king hiero goldsmith was embezzl gold dure the manufactur of a golden wreath dedic to the god and replac it with another, cheaper alloy. archimed knew that the irregular shape wreath could be crush into a cube whose volum could be calcul easili and compar with the mass; but the king did not approv of this. baffled, archimed is said to have taken an immers bath and observ from the rise of the water upon enter that he could calcul the volum of the gold wreath through the displac of the water. upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran nake through the street shouting, \"eureka! eureka!\" (\u03b5\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1! greek \"i have found it\"). as a result, the term \"eureka\" enter common parlanc and is use today to indic a moment of enlightenment. the stori first appear in written form in vitruvius book of architecture, two centuri after it suppos took place. some scholar have doubt the accuraci of this tale, say among other thing that the method would have requir precis measur that would have been difficult to make at the time.from the equat for densiti (\u03c1 = m/v), mass densiti has unit of mass divid by volume. as there are mani unit of mass and volum cover mani differ magnitud there are a larg number of unit for mass densiti in use. the si unit of kilogram per cubic metr and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimetr are probabl the most common use unit for density. one is equal to one cubic centimetr (abbrevi cc) is equal to one millilitre. in industry, other larger or smaller unit of mass and or volum are often more practic and us customari unit may be used. see below for a list of some of the most common unit of density. == measur of densiti == a number of techniqu as well as standard exist for the measur of densiti of materials. such techniqu includ the use of a hydromet (a buoyanc method for liquids), hydrostat balanc (a buoyanc method for liquid and solids), immers bodi method (a buoyanc method for liquids), pycnomet (liquid and solids), air comparison pycnomet (solids), oscil densitomet (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids). however, each individu method or techniqu measur differ type of densiti (e.g. bulk density, skelet density, etc.), and therefor it is necessari to have an understand of the type of densiti be measur as well as the type of materi in question. === homogen materi === the densiti at all point of a homogen object equal it total mass divid by it total volume. the mass is normal measur with a scale or balance; the volum may be measur direct (from the geometri of the object) or by the displac of a fluid. to determin the densiti of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymet or a corioli flow meter may be used, respectively. similarly, hydrostat weigh use the displac of water due to a submerg object to determin the densiti of the object. === heterogen materi === if the bodi is not homogeneous, then it densiti vari between differ region of the object. in that case the densiti around ani given locat is determin by calcul the densiti of a small volum around that location. in the limit of an infinitesim volum the densiti of an inhomogen object at a point becomes: \u03c1 ( r \u2192 ) = d m / d v {\\displaystyl \\rho ({\\vec {r}})=dm/dv} , where d v {\\displaystyl dv} is an elementari volum at posit r {\\displaystyl r} . the mass of the bodi then can be express as m = \u222b v \u03c1 ( r \u2192 ) d v . {\\displaystyl m=\\int _{v}\\rho ({\\vec {r}})\\,dv.} === non-compact materi === in practice, bulk materi such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. mani materi exist in natur as flakes, pellets, or granules. void are region which contain someth other than the consid material. common the void is air, but it could also be vacuum, liquid, solid, or a differ gas or gaseous mixture. the bulk volum of a material\u2014inclus of the void fraction\u2014i often obtain by a simpl measur (e.g. with a calibr measur cup) or geometr from known dimensions. mass divid by bulk volum determin bulk density. this is not the same thing as volumetr mass density. to determin volumetr mass density, one must first discount the volum of the void fraction. sometim this can be determin by geometr reasoning. for the close-pack of equal sphere the non-void fraction can be at most about it can also be determin empirically. some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a variabl void fraction which depend on how the materi is agit or poured. it might be loos or compact, with more or less air space depend on handling. in practice, the void fraction is not necessarili air, or even gaseous. in the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantag for measur as the void fraction for sand satur in water\u2014onc ani air bubbl are thorough driven out\u2014i potenti more consist than dri sand measur with an air void. in the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determin the mass of the materi sample. if the materi is under pressur (common ambient air pressur at the earth surface) the determin of mass from a measur sampl weight might need to account for buoyanc effect due to the densiti of the void constituent, depend on how the measur was conducted. in the case of dri sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyanc effect is common neglect (less than one part in one thousand). mass chang upon displac one void materi with anoth while maintain constant volum can be use to estim the void fraction, if the differ in densiti of the two void materi is reliabl known. == chang of densiti == in general, densiti can be chang by chang either the pressur or the temperature. increas the pressur alway increas the densiti of a material. increas the temperatur general decreas the density, but there are notabl except to this generalization. for example, the densiti of water increas between it melt point at \u00b0c and \u00b0c;

    "in physic energi is the quantit properti that must be transfer to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object energi is a conserv quantiti the law of conserv of energi state that

object s total mass just as it increas it total energi for exampl after heat an object it increas in energi could be measur as a small increas in mass, with a sensit enough scale. live organ requir energi to stay alive, such as the energi human get from food. human civil requir energi to function, which it get from energi resourc such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renew energy. the process of earth climat and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energi earth receiv from the sun and the geotherm energi contain within the earth. == form == the total energi of a system can be subdivid and classifi into potenti energy, kinet energy, or combin of the two in various ways. kinet energi is determin by the movement of an object \u2013 or the composit motion of the compon of an object \u2013 and potenti energi reflect the potenti of an object to have motion, and general is a function of the posit of an object within a field or may be store in the field itself. while these two categori are suffici to describ all form of energy, it is often conveni to refer to particular combin of potenti and kinet energi as it own form. for example, macroscop mechan energi is the sum of translat and rotat kinet and potenti energi in a system neglect the kinet energi due to temperature, and nuclear energi which combin potenti from the nuclear forc and the weak force), among others. == histori == the word energi deriv from the ancient greek: \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, romanized: energeia, lit. activity, operation', which possibl appear for the first time in the work of aristotl in the centuri bc. in contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualit philosoph concept, broad enough to includ idea such as happi and pleasure. in the late century, gottfri leibniz propos the idea of the latin: vis viva, or live force, which defin as the product of the mass of an object and it veloc squared; he believ that total vis viva was conserved. to account for slow due to friction, leibniz theoriz that thermal energi consist of the random motion of the constitu part of matter, although it would be more than a centuri until this was general accepted. the modern analog of this property, kinet energy, differ from vis viva onli by a factor of two. in thoma young was possibl the first to use the term \"energy\" instead of vis viva, in it modern sense. gustave-gaspard corioli describ \"kinet energy\" in in it modern sense, and in william rankin coin the term \"potenti energy\". the law of conserv of energi was also first postul in the earli century, and appli to ani isol system. it was argu for some year whether heat was a physic substance, dub the caloric, or mere a physic quantity, such as momentum. in jame prescott joul discov the link between mechan work and the generat of heat. these develop led to the theori of conserv of energy, formal larg by william thomson (lord kelvin) as the field of thermodynamics. thermodynam aid the rapid develop of explan of chemic process by rudolf clausius, josiah willard gibbs, and walther nernst. it also led to a mathemat formul of the concept of entropi by clausius and to the introduct of law of radiant energi by jo\u017eef stefan. accord to noether theorem, the conserv of energi is a consequ of the fact that the law of physic do not chang over time. thus, sinc theorist have understood that the law of conserv of energi is the direct mathemat consequ of the translat symmetri of the quantiti conjug to energy, name time. == unit of measur == in jame prescott joul independ discov the mechan equival in a seri of experiments. the most famous of them use the \"joul apparatus\": a descend weight, attach to a string, caus rotat of a paddl immers in water, practic insul from heat transfer. it show that the gravit potenti energi lost by the weight in descend was equal to the intern energi gain by the water through friction with the paddle. in the intern system of unit (si), the unit of energi is the joule, name after joule. it is a deriv unit. it is equal to the energi expend (or work done) in appli a forc of one newton through a distanc of one metre. howev energi is also express in mani other unit not part of the si, such as ergs, calories, british thermal units, kilowatt-hour and kilocalories, which requir a convers factor when express in si units. the si unit of energi rate (energi per unit time) is the watt, which is a joul per second. thus, one joul is one watt-second, and joul equal one watt-hour. the cgs energi unit is the erg and the imperi and us customari unit is the foot pound. other energi unit such as the electronvolt, food calori or thermodynam kcal (base on the temperatur chang of water in a heat process), and btu are use in specif area of scienc and commerce. == scientif use == === classic mechan === in classic mechanics, energi is a conceptu and mathemat use property, as it is a conserv quantity. sever formul of mechan have been develop use energi as a core concept. work, a function of energy, is forc time distance. w = \u222b c f \u22c5 d s {\\displaystyl w=\\int _{c}\\mathbf {f} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {s} } this say that the work ( w {\\displaystyl w} ) is equal to the line integr of the forc f along a path c; for detail see the mechan work article. work and thus energi is frame dependent. for example, consid a ball be hit by a bat. in the center-of-mass refer frame, the bat doe no work on the ball. but, in the refer frame of the person swing the bat, consider work is done on the ball. the total energi of a system is sometim call the hamiltonian, after william rowan hamilton. the classic equat of motion can be written in term of the hamiltonian, even for high complex or abstract systems. these classic equat have remark direct analog in nonrelativist quantum mechanics.anoth energy-rel concept is call the lagrangian, after joseph-loui lagrange. this formal is as fundament as the hamiltonian, and both can be use to deriv the equat of motion or be deriv from them. it was invent in the context of classic mechanics, but is general use in modern physics. the lagrangian is defin as the kinet energi minus the potenti energy. usually, the lagrang formal is mathemat more conveni than the hamiltonian for non-conserv system (such as system with friction). noether theorem state that ani differenti symmetri of the action of a physic system has a correspond conserv law. noether theorem has becom a fundament tool of modern theoret physic and the calculus of variations. a generalis of the semin formul on constant of motion in lagrangian and hamiltonian mechan and respectively), it doe not appli to system that cannot be model with a lagrangian; for example, dissip system with continu symmetri need not have a correspond conserv law. === chemistri === in the context of chemistry, energi is an attribut of a substanc as a consequ of it atomic, molecular, or aggreg structure. sinc a chemic transform is accompani by a chang in one or more of these kind of structure, it is invari accompani by an increas or decreas of energi of the substanc involved. some energi is transfer between the surround and the reactant of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the product of a reaction may have more or less energi than the reactants. a reaction is said to be exotherm or exergon if the final state is lower on the energi scale than the initi state; in the case of endotherm reaction the situat is the reverse. chemic reaction are usual not possibl unless the reactant surmount an energi barrier known as the activ energy. the speed of a chemic reaction (at given temperatur t) is relat to the activ energi e by the boltzmann popul factor e\u2212e/kt \u2013 that is the probabl of molecul to have energi greater than or equal to e at the given temperatur t. this exponenti depend of a reaction rate on temperatur is known as the arrhenius equation. the activ energi necessari for a chemic reaction can be provid in the form of thermal energy. === biolog === in biology, energi is an attribut of all biolog system from the biospher to the smallest live organism. within an organ it is respons for growth and develop of a biolog cell or an organell of a biolog organism. energi use in respir is most store in molecular oxygen and can be unlock by reaction with molecul of substanc such as carbohydr (includ sugars), lipids, and protein store by cells. in human terms, the human equival (h-e) (human energi conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energi expenditure, the relat quantiti of energi need for human metabolism, assum an averag human energi expenditur of kj per day and a basal metabol rate of watts. for example, if our bodi run (on average) at watts, then a light bulb run at watt is run at human equival \u00f7 i.e. h-e. for a difficult task of onli a few second duration, a person can put out thousand of watts, mani time the watt in one offici horsepower. for task last a few minutes, a fit human can generat perhap watts. for an activ that must be sustain for an hour, output drop to around for an activ kept up all day, watt is about the maximum. the human equival assist understand of energi flow in physic and biolog system by express energi unit in human terms: it provid a \"feel\" for the use of a given amount of energy.sunlight radiant energi is also captur by plant as chemic potenti energi in photosynthesis, when carbon dioxid and water (two low-energi compounds) are convert into carbohydrates, lipids, and protein and high-energi compound like oxygen and atp. carbohydrates, lipids, and protein can releas the energi of oxygen, which is util by live organ as an electron acceptor. releas of the energi store dure photosynthesi as heat or light may be trigger sudden by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made avail more slowli for anim or human metabolism, when organ molecul are ingested, and catabol is trigger by enzym action. ani live organ reli on an extern sourc of energi \u2013 radiant energi from the sun in the case of green plants, chemic energi in some form in the case of anim \u2013 to be abl to grow and reproduce. the daili calori mj) recommend for a human adult are taken as a combin of oxygen and food molecules, the latter most carbohydr and fats, of which glucos and stearin are conveni examples. the food molecul are

to convert adp into atp. adp + \u2192 atp + rest of the chemic energi in and the carbohydr or fat is convert into heat: the atp is use as a sort of \"energi currency\", and some of the chemic energi it contain is use for other metabol when atp react with oh group and eventu split into adp and phosphat (at each stage of a metabol pathway, some chemic energi is convert into heat). onli a tini fraction of the origin chemic energi is use for work: gain in kinet energi of a sprinter dure a m race: kj gain in gravit potenti energi of a kg weight lift through metres: kj daili food intak of a normal adult: mjit would appear that live organ are remark ineffici (in the physic sense) in their use of the energi they receiv (chemic or radiant energy), and it is true that most real machin manag higher efficiencies. in grow organ the energi that is convert to heat serv a vital purpose, as it allow the organ tissu to be high order with regard to the molecul it is built from. the second law of thermodynam state that energi (and matter) tend to becom more even spread out across the universe: to concentr energi (or matter) in one specif place, it is necessari to spread out a greater amount of energi (as heat) across the remaind of the univers (\"the surroundings\"). simpler organ can achiev higher energi effici than more complex ones, but the complex organ can occupi ecolog nich that are not avail to their simpler brethren. the convers of a portion of the chemic energi to heat at each step in a metabol pathway is the physic reason behind the pyramid of biomass observ in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estim pg/a of carbon that is fix by photosynthesis, pg/a are use for the metabol of green plants, i.e. reconvert into carbon dioxid and heat. === earth scienc === in geology, continent drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquak are phenomena that can be explain in term of energi transform in the earth interior, while meteorolog phenomena like wind, rain, hail, snow, lightning, tornado and hurrican are all a result of energi transform brought about by solar energi on the atmospher of the planet earth. sunlight may be store as gravit potenti energi after it strike the earth, as (for example) water evapor from ocean and is deposit upon mountain (where, after be releas at a hydroelectr dam, it can be use to drive turbin or generat to produc electricity). sunlight also drive mani weather phenomena, save those generat by volcan events. an exampl of a solar-medi weather event is a hurricane, which occur when larg unstabl area of warm ocean, heat over months, give up some of their thermal energi sudden to power a few day of violent air movement. in a slower process, radioact decay of atom in the core of the earth releas heat. this thermal energi drive plate tecton and may lift mountains, via orogenesis. this slow lift repres a kind of gravit potenti energi storag of the thermal energy, which may be later releas to activ kinet energi in landslides, after a trigger event. earthquak also releas store elast potenti energi in rocks, a store that has been produc ultim from the same radioact heat sources. thus, accord to present understanding, familiar event such as landslid and earthquak releas energi that has been store as potenti energi in the earth gravit field or elast strain (mechan potenti energy) in rocks. prior to this, they repres releas of energi that has been store in heavi atom sinc the collaps of long-destroy supernova star creat these atoms. === cosmolog === in cosmolog and astronomi the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasar and gamma-ray burst are the univers highest-output energi transform of matter. all stellar phenomena (includ solar activity) are driven by various kind of energi transformations. energi in such transform is either from gravit collaps of matter (usual molecular hydrogen) into various class of astronom object (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarili hydrogen). the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the sun also releas anoth store of potenti energi which was creat at the time of the big bang. at that time, accord to theory, space expand and the univers cool too rapid for hydrogen to complet fuse into heavier elements. this meant that hydrogen repres a store of potenti energi that can be releas by fusion. such a fusion process is trigger by heat and pressur generat from gravit collaps of hydrogen cloud when they produc stars, and some of the fusion energi is then transform into sunlight. === quantum mechan === in quantum mechanics, energi is defin in term of the energi oper as a time deriv of the wave function. the schr\u00f6dinger equat equat the energi oper to the full energi of a particl or a system. it result can be consid as a definit of measur of energi in quantum mechanics. the schr\u00f6dinger equat describ the space- and time-depend of a slowli chang (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. the solut of this equat for a bound system is discret (a set of permit states, each character by an energi level) which result in the concept of quanta. in the solut of the schr\u00f6dinger equat for ani oscil (vibrator) and for electromagnet wave in a vacuum, the result energi state are relat to the frequenc by planck relation: e = h \u03bd {\\displaystyl e=h\\nu } (where h {\\displaystyl h} is planck constant and \u03bd {\\displaystyl \\nu } the frequency). in the case of an electromagnet wave these energi state are call quanta of light or photons. === relat === when calcul kinet energi (work to acceler a massiv bodi from zero speed to some finit speed) relativist \u2013 use lorentz transform instead of newtonian mechan \u2013 einstein discov an unexpect by-product of these calcul to be an energi term which doe not vanish at zero speed. he call it rest energy: energi which everi massiv bodi must possess even when be at rest. the amount of energi is direct proport to the mass of the body: e = m c {\\displaystyl ,where m is the mass of the body, c is the speed of light in vacuum, e {\\displaystyl is the rest energy.for example, consid electron\u2013positron annihilation, in which the rest energi of these two individu particl (equival to their rest mass) is convert to the radiant energi of the photon produc in the process. in this system the matter and antimatt (electron and positrons) are destroy and chang to non-matt (the photons). however, the total mass and total energi do not chang dure this interaction. the photon each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energi which exhibit the same inertia as did the two origin particles. this is a revers process \u2013 the invers process is call pair creation \u2013 in which the rest mass of particl is creat from the radiant energi of two (or more) annihil photons. in general relativity, the stress\u2013energi tensor serv as the sourc term for the gravit field, in rough analog to the way mass serv as the sourc term in the non-relativist newtonian approximation.energi and mass are manifest of one and the same under physic properti of a system. this properti is respons for the inertia and strength of gravit interact of the system (\"mass manifestations\"), and is also respons for the potenti abil of the system to perform work or heat (\"energi manifestations\"), subject to the limit of other physic laws. in classic physics, energi is a scalar quantity, the canon conjug to time. in special relat energi is also a scalar (although not a lorentz scalar but a time compon of the energy\u2013momentum in other words, energi is invari with respect to rotat of space, but not invari with respect to rotat of spacetim (= boosts). == transform == energi may be transform between differ form at various efficiencies. item that transform between these form are call transducers. exampl of transduc includ a battery, from chemic energi to electr energy; a dam: gravit potenti energi to kinet energi of move water (and the blade of a turbine) and ultim to electr energi through an electr generator; or a heat engine, from heat to work. exampl of energi transform includ generat electr energi from heat energi via a steam turbine, or lift an object against graviti use electr energi drive a crane motor. lift against graviti perform mechan work on the object and store gravit potenti energi in the object. if the object fall to the ground, graviti doe mechan work on the object which transform the potenti energi in the gravit field to the kinet energi releas as heat on impact with the ground. our sun transform nuclear potenti energi to other form of energy; it total mass doe not decreas due to that in itself (sinc it still contain the same total energi even if in differ forms), but it mass doe decreas when the energi escap out to it surroundings, larg as radiant energy. there are strict limit to how effici heat can be convert into work in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as describ by carnot theorem and the second law of thermodynamics. however, some energi transform can be quit efficient. the direct of transform in energi (what kind of energi is transform to what other kind) is often determin by entropi (equal energi spread among all avail degre of freedom) considerations. in practic all energi transform are permit on a small scale, but certain larger transform are not permit becaus it is statist unlik that energi or matter will random move into more concentr form or smaller spaces. energi transform in the univers over time are character by various kind of potenti energi that has been avail sinc the big bang later be \"released\" (transform to more activ type of energi such as kinet or radiant energy) when a trigger mechan is available. familiar exampl of such process includ nuclear decay, in which energi is releas that was origin \"stored\" in heavi isotop (such as uranium and thorium), by nucleosynthesis, a process ultim use the gravit potenti energi releas from the gravit collaps of supernovae, to store energi in the creation of these heavi element befor they were incorpor into the solar system and the earth. this energi is trigger and releas in nuclear fission bomb or in civil nuclear power generation. similarly, in the case of a chemic explosion, chemic potenti energi is transform to kinet energi and thermal energi in a veri short time. yet anoth exampl is that of a pendulum. at it highest point the kinet energi is zero and the gravit potenti energi is at maximum. at it lowest point the kinet energi is at maximum and is equal to the decreas of potenti energy. if one (unrealistically) assum that there is no friction or other losses, the convers of energi between these process would be perfect, and the pendulum would continu swing forever. energi is also transfer from potenti energi ( e p {\\displaystyl e_{p}} ) to kinet energi ( e k {\\displaystyl e_{k}} ) and then back to potenti energi constantly. this is refer to as conserv of energy. in this close system, energi cannot be creat or destroyed; therefore, the initi energi and the final energi will be equal to each other. this can be demonstr by the following: the equat can then be simplifi further sinc e p = m g h {\\displaystyl e_{p}=mgh} (mass time acceler due to graviti time the height) and e k = m v {\\displaystyl e_{k}={\\frac (half mass time veloc squared). then the total amount of energi can be found by ad e p + e k = e t o t a l {\\displaystyl e_{p}+e_{k}=e_{total}} . === conserv of energi and mass in transform === energi give rise to weight when it is trap in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. it is also equival to mass, and this mass is alway associ with it. mass is also equival to a certain amount of energy, and likewis alway appear associ with it, as describ in mass-energi equivalence. the formula e = mc\u00b2, deriv by albert einstein quantifi the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energi within the concept of special relativity. in differ theoret frameworks, similar formula were deriv by j.j. thomson henri poincar\u00e9 friedrich hasen\u00f6hrl and other (see mass-energi equivalence#histori for further information). part of the rest energi (equival to rest mass) of matter may be convert to other form of energi (still exhibit mass), but neither energi nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant dure ani process. however, sinc c {\\displaystyl is extrem larg relat to ordinari human scales, the convers of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, kg) from rest energi to other form of energi (such as kinet energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energi carri by light and other radiation) can liber tremend amount of energi (~ \u00d7 {\\displaystyl joul = megaton of tnt), as can be seen in nuclear reactor and nuclear weapons. conversely, the mass equival of an everyday amount energi is minuscule, which is whi a loss of energi (loss of mass) from most system is difficult to measur on a weigh scale, unless the energi loss is veri large. exampl of larg transform between rest energi (of matter) and other form of energi (e.g., kinet energi into particl with rest mass) are found in nuclear physic and particl physics. === revers and non-revers transform === thermodynam divid energi transform into two kinds: revers process and irrevers processes. an irrevers process is one in which energi is dissip (spread) into empti energi state avail in a volume, from which it cannot be recov into more concentr form (fewer quantum states), without degrad of even more energy. a revers process is one in which this sort of dissip doe not happen. for example, convers of energi from one type of potenti field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system describ above. in process where heat is generated, quantum state of lower energy, present as possibl excit in field between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be convert with effici into other form of energy. in this case, the energi must part stay as heat, and cannot be complet recov as usabl energy, except at the price of an increas in some other kind of heat-lik increas in disord in quantum states, in the univers (such as an expans of matter, or a randomis in a crystal). as the univers evolv in time, more and more of it energi becom trap in irrevers state (i.e., as heat or other kind of increas in disorder). this has been refer to as the inevit thermodynam heat death of the universe. in this heat death the energi of the univers doe not change, but the fraction of energi which is avail to do work through a heat engine, or be transform to other usabl form of energi (through the use of generat attach to heat engines), grow less and less. == conserv of energi == the fact that energi can be neither creat nor be destroy is call the law of conserv of energy. in the form of the first law of thermodynamics, this state that a close system energi is constant unless energi is transfer in or out by work or heat, and that no energi is lost in transfer. the total inflow of energi into a system must equal the total outflow of energi from the system, plus the chang in the energi contain within the system. whenev one measur (or calculates) the total energi of a system of particl whose interact do not depend explicit on time, it is found that the total energi of the system alway remain constant.whil heat can alway be fulli convert into work in a revers isotherm expans of an ideal gas, for cyclic process of practic interest in heat engin the second law of thermodynam state that the system do work alway lose some energi as wast heat. this creat a limit to the amount of heat energi that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit call the avail energy. mechan and other form of energi can be transform in the other direct into thermal energi without such limitations. the total energi of a system can be calcul by ad up all form of energi in the system. richard feynman said dure a lecture: there is a fact, or if you wish, a law, govern all natur phenomena that are known to date. there is no known except to this law \u2013 it is exact so far as we know. the law is call the conserv of energy. it state that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that doe not chang in manifold chang which natur undergoes. that is a most abstract idea, becaus it is a mathemat principle; it say that there is a numer quantiti which doe not chang when someth happens. it is not a descript of a mechanism, or anyth concrete; it is just a strang fact that we can calcul some number and when we finish watch natur go through her trick and calcul the number again, it is the same. most kind of energi (with gravit energi be a notabl exception) are subject to strict local conserv law as well. in this case, energi can onli be exchang between adjac region of space, and all observ agre as to the volumetr densiti of energi in ani given space. there is also a global law of conserv of energy, state that the total energi of the univers cannot change; this is a corollari of the local law, but not vice versa.thi law is a fundament principl of physics. as shown rigor by noether theorem, the conserv of energi is a mathemat consequ of translat symmetri of time, a properti of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that make them independ of their locat on the time coordinate. put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physic indistinguishable. this is becaus energi is the quantiti which is canon conjug to time. this mathemat entangl of energi and time also result in the uncertainti principl - it is imposs to defin the exact amount of energi dure ani definit time interval. the uncertainti principl should not be confus with energi conserv - rather it provid mathemat limit to which energi can in principl be defin and measured. each of the basic forc of natur is associ with a differ type of potenti energy, and all type of potenti energi (like all other type of energy) appear as system mass, whenev present. for example, a compress spring will be slight more massiv than befor it was compressed. likewise, whenev energi is transfer between system by ani mechanism, an associ mass is transfer with it. in quantum mechan energi is express use the hamiltonian operator. on ani time scales, the uncertainti in the energi is by \u03b4 e \u03b4 t \u2265 \u210f {\\displaystyl \\delta e\\delta t\\geq {\\frac {\\hbar which is similar in form to the heisenberg uncertainti principl (but not realli mathemat equival thereto, sinc h and t are not dynam conjug variables, neither in classic nor in quantum mechanics). in particl physics, this inequ permit a qualit understand of virtual particl which carri momentum, exchang by which and with real particles, is respons for the creation of all known fundament forc (more accur known as fundament interactions). virtual photon are also respons for electrostat interact between electr charg (which result in coulomb law), for spontan radiat decay of exit atom and nuclear states, for the casimir force, for van der waal bond forc and some other observ phenomena. == energi transfer == === close system === energi transfer can be consid for the special case of system which are close to transfer of matter. the portion of the energi which is transfer by conserv forc over a distanc is measur as the work the sourc system doe on the receiv system. the portion of the energi which doe not do work dure the transfer is call heat. energi can be transfer between system in a varieti of ways. exampl includ the transmiss of electromagnet energi via photons, physic collis which transfer kinet energy, and the conduct transfer of thermal energy. energi is strict conserv and is also local conserv wherev it can be defined. in thermodynamics, for close systems, the process of energi transfer is describ by the first law: where e {\\displaystyl e} is the amount of energi transferred, w {\\displaystyl w} repres the work done on the system, and q {\\displaystyl q} repres the heat flow into the system. as a simplification, the heat term, q {\\displaystyl q} , is sometim ignored, especi when the thermal effici of the transfer is high. this simplifi equat is the one use to defin the joule, for example. === open system === beyond the constraint of close systems, open system can gain or lose energi in associ with matter transfer (both of these process are illustr by fuel an auto, a system which gain in energi thereby, without addit of either work or heat). denot this energi by e {\\displaystyl e} , one may write == thermodynam == === intern energi === intern energi is the sum of all microscop form of energi of a system. it is the energi need to creat the system. it is relat to the potenti energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometr aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinet energy. thermodynam is chiefli concern with chang in intern energi and not it absolut value, which is imposs to determin with thermodynam alone. === first law of thermodynam === the first law of thermodynam assert that energi (but not necessarili thermodynam free energy) is alway conserv and that heat flow is a form of energi transfer. for homogen systems, with a well-defin temperatur and pressure, a common use corollari of the first law is that, for a system subject onli to pressur forc and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-ful of gas) without chemic changes, the differenti chang in the intern energi of the system (with a gain in energi signifi by a posit quantity) is given as d e = t d s \u2212 p d v {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {d} e=t\\mathrm {d} s-p\\mathrm {d} v\\,} ,where the first term on the right is the heat transfer into the system, express in term of temperatur t and entropi s (in which entropi increas and the chang ds is posit when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identifi as work done on the system, where pressur is p and volum v (the negat sign result sinc compress of the system requir work to be done on it and so the volum change, dv, is negat when work is done on the system). this equat is high specific, ignor all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravit forces, effect such as advect of ani form of energi other than heat and pv-work. the general formul of the first law (i.e., conserv of energy) is valid even in situat in which the system is not homogeneous. for these case the chang in intern energi of a close system is express in a general form by d e = \u03b4 q + \u03b4 w {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {d} e=\\delta q+\\delta w} where \u03b4 q {\\displaystyl \\delta q} is the heat suppli to the system and \u03b4 w {\\displaystyl \\delta w} is the work appli to the system. === equipartit of energi === the energi of a mechan harmon oscil (a mass on a spring) is altern kinet and potenti energy. at two point in the oscil cycl it is entir kinetic, and at two point it is entir potential. over the whole cycle, or over mani cycles, net energi is thus equal split between kinet and potential. this is call equipartit principle; total energi of a system with mani degre of freedom is equal split among all avail degre of freedom. this principl is vital import to understand the behaviour of a quantiti close relat to energy, call entropy. entropi is a measur of even of a distribut of energi between part of a system. when an isol system is given more degre of freedom (i.e., given new avail energi state that are the same as exist states), then total energi spread over all avail degre equal without distinct between \"new\" and \"old\" degrees. this mathemat result is call the second law of thermodynamics. the second law of thermodynam is valid onli for system which are near or in equilibrium state. for non-equilibrium systems, the law govern system behavior are still debatable. one of the guid principl for these system is the principl of maximum entropi production. it state that nonequilibrium system behav in such a way to maxim it entropi production. == see also == == note == == refer == == further read == === journal === the journal of energi histori / revu d'histoir de l'\u00e9nergi

the earli century, surviv in a singl manuscript, the textus roffensi from paragraph lxvii set out the fine for wound of various depths: one inch, one shilling; two inches, two shillings, etc.an anglo-saxon unit of length was the barleycorn. after inch was equal to barleycorns, which continu to be it legal definit for sever centuries, with the barleycorn be the base unit. one of the earliest such definit is that of where the legal definit of the inch was set out in a statut of edward ii of england, defin it as \"three grain of barley, dri and round, place end to end, lengthwise\".similar definit are record in both english and welsh mediev law tracts. one, date from the first half of the century, is contain in the law of hywel dda which supersed those of dyfnwal, an even earlier definit of the inch in wales. both definitions, as record in ancient law and institut of wale (vol i., pp. are that \"three length of a barleycorn is the inch\".k david i of scotland in his assiz of weight and measur (c. is said to have defin the scottish inch as the width of an averag man thumb at the base of the nail, even includ the requir to calcul the averag of a small, a medium, and a larg man measures. however, the oldest surviv manuscript date from the earli centuri and appear to have been alter with the inclus of newer material.in charl butler, a mathemat teacher at cheam school, record the old legal definit of the inch to be \"three grain of sound ripe barley be taken out the middl of the ear, well dried, and laid end to end in a row\", and place the barleycorn, not the inch, as the base unit of the english long measur system, from which all other unit were derived. john bouvier similar record in his law dictionari that the barleycorn was the fundament measure. butler observed, however, that \"[a] the length of the barley-corn cannot be fixed, so the inch accord to this method will be uncertain\", note that a standard inch measur was now [i.e. by kept in the exchequ chamber, guildhall, and that was the legal definit of the inch.thi was a point also made by georg long in his penni cyclop\u00e6dia, observ that standard measur had sinc surpass the barleycorn definit of the inch, and that to recov the inch measur from it origin definition, in the event that the standard measur were destroyed, would involv the measur of larg number of barleycorn and take their averag lengths. he note that this process would not perfect recov the standard, sinc it might introduc error of anywher between one hundredth and one tenth of an inch in the definit of a yard.befor the adopt of the intern yard and pound, various definit were in use. in the unit kingdom and most countri of the british commonwealth, the inch was defin in term of the imperi standard yard. the unit state adopt the convers factor metr = inch by an act in in mendenhal order the physic realiz of the inch to be base on the intern prototyp metr number and which had been receiv from the

rather, they depend on how quick the shear occurs. viscos is the materi properti which relat the viscous stress in a materi to the rate of chang of a deform (the strain rate). although it appli to general flows, it is easi to visual and defin in a simpl shear flow, such as a planar couett flow. in the couett flow, a fluid is trap between two infinit larg plates, one fix and one in parallel motion at constant speed u {\\displaystyl u} (see illustr to the right). if the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steadi state the fluid particl move parallel to it, and their speed vari from {\\displaystyl at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. each layer of fluid move faster than the one just below it, and friction between them give rise to a forc resist their relat motion. in particular, the fluid appli on the top plate a forc in the direct opposit to it motion, and an equal but opposit forc on the bottom plate. an extern forc is therefor requir in order to keep the top plate move at constant speed. in mani fluids, the flow veloc is observ to vari linear from zero at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. moreover, the magnitud f {\\displaystyl f} of the forc act on the top plate is found to be proport to the speed u {\\displaystyl u} and the area a {\\displaystyl a} of each plate, and invers proport to their separ y {\\displaystyl y} : f = \u03bc a u y . {\\displaystyl f=\\mu a{\\frac {u}{y}}.} the proport factor \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is the dynam viscos of the fluid, with unit of pa \u22c5 s {\\displaystyl {\\text{pa}}\\cdot {\\text{s}}} (pascal-second), often simpli refer to as the viscosity. the ratio u / y {\\displaystyl u/y} is call the rate of shear deform or shear velocity, and is the deriv of the fluid speed in the direct perpendicular to the plate (see illustr to the right). if the veloc doe not vari linear with y {\\displaystyl y} , then the appropri general is: \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y , {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}},} where \u03c4 = f / a {\\displaystyl \\tau =f/a} , and \u2202 u / \u2202 y {\\displaystyl \\partial u/\\parti y} is the local shear velocity. this express is refer to as newton law of viscosity. in shear flow with planar symmetry, it is what defin \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is a special case of the general definit of viscos (see below), which can be express in coordinate-fre form. use of the greek letter mu ( \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } ) for the dynam viscos (sometim also call the absolut viscosity) is common among mechan and chemic engineers, as well as mathematician and physicists. however, the greek letter eta ( \u03b7 {\\displaystyl \\eta } ) is also use by chemists, physicists, and the iupac. the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is sometim also call the shear viscosity. however, at least one author discourag the use of this terminology, note that \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } can appear in nonshear flow in addit to shear flows. === general definit === in veri general terms, the viscous stress in a fluid are defin as those result from the relat veloc of differ fluid particles. as such, the viscous stress must depend on spatial gradient of the flow velocity. if the veloc gradient are small, then to a first approxim the viscous stress depend onli on the first deriv of the velocity. (for newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) in cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as \u03c4 i j = \u2211 k \u2211 \u2113 \u03bc i j k \u2113 \u2202 v k \u2202 r \u2113 , {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}=\\sum _{k}\\sum _{\\ell }\\mu _{ijk\\el }{\\frac {\\partial v_{k}}{\\partial r_{\\ell }}},} where \u03bc i j k \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijk\\el }} is a viscos tensor that map the veloc gradient tensor \u2202 v k / \u2202 r \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\partial v_{k}/\\partial r_{\\ell }} onto the viscous stress tensor \u03c4 i j {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}} . sinc the indic in this express can vari from to there are \"viscos coefficients\" \u03bc i j k l {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijkl}} in total. however, assum that the viscos tensor is isotrop reduc these coeffici to three independ paramet \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , \u03b2 {\\displaystyl \\beta } , \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\gamma } : \u03bc i j k \u2113 = \u03b1 \u03b4 i j \u03b4 k \u2113 + \u03b2 \u03b4 i k \u03b4 j \u2113 + \u03b3 \u03b4 i \u2113 \u03b4 j k , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijk\\el }=\\alpha \\delta _{ij}\\delta _{k\\ell }+\\beta \\delta _{ik}\\delta _{j\\ell }+\\gamma \\delta _{i\\el }\\delta _{jk},} and furthermore, it is assum that no viscous forc may aris when the fluid is undergo simpl rigid-bodi rotation, thus \u03b2 = \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\beta =\\gamma } , leav onli two independ parameters. the most usual decomposit is in term of the standard (scalar) viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } and the bulk viscos \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } such that \u03b1 = \u03ba \u2212 \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\alpha =\\kappa -{\\tfrac } and \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\beta =\\gamma =\\mu } . in vector notat this appear as: \u03c4 = \u03bc [ \u2207 v + ( \u2207 v ) \u2020 ] \u2212 ( \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba ) ( \u2207 \u22c5 v ) \u03b4 , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {\\tau } =\\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf {v} +(\\nabla \\mathbf {v} )^{\\dagger }\\right]-\\left({\\frac -\\kappa \\right)(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} )\\mathbf {\\delta } ,} where \u03b4 {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {\\delta } } is the unit tensor, and the dagger \u2020 {\\displaystyl \\dagger } denot the transpose. this equat can be thought of as a general form of newton law of viscosity. the bulk viscos (also call volum viscosity) express a type of intern friction that resist the shearless compress or expans of a fluid. knowledg of \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is frequent not necessari in fluid dynam problems. for example, an incompress fluid satisfi \u2207 \u22c5 v = {\\displaystyl \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} and so the term contain \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } drop out. moreover, \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is often assum to be neglig for gase sinc it is {\\displaystyl in a monatom ideal gas. one situat in which \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } can be import is the calcul of energi loss in sound and shock waves, describ by stoke law of sound attenuation, sinc these phenomena involv rapid expans and compressions. it is worth emphas that the abov express are not fundament law of nature, but rather definit of viscosity. as such, their util for ani given material, as well as mean for measur or calcul the viscosity, must be establish use separ means. === kinemat viscos === in fluid dynamics, it is sometim more conveni to work in term of the kinemat viscos (sometim also call the momentum diffusivity), defin as the ratio of the viscos \u03bc to the densiti of the fluid \u03c1. it is usual denot by the greek letter nu (\u03bd) and has dimens ( l e n g t h ) / t i m e {\\displaystyl \\mathrm } : \u03bd = \u03bc \u03c1 , {\\displaystyl \\nu ={\\frac {\\mu }{\\rho }},} in order to distinguish it from the dynam viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which has dimens f o r c e \u00d7 t i m e / a r e a {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {force\\tim time/area} } . == momentum transport == transport theori provid an altern interpret of viscos in term of momentum transport: viscos is the materi properti which character momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conduct character heat transport, and (mass) diffus character mass transport. to see this, note that in newton law of viscosity, \u03c4 = \u03bc ( \u2202 u / \u2202 y ) {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu (\\partial u/\\parti y)} , the shear stress \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } has unit equival to a momentum flux, i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. thus, \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } can be interpret as specifi the flow of momentum in the y {\\displaystyl y} direct from one fluid layer to the next. per newton law of viscosity, this momentum flow occur across a veloc gradient, and the magnitud of the correspond momentum flux is determin by the viscosity. the analog with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. just as heat flow from high temperatur to low temperatur and mass flow from high densiti to low density, momentum flow from high veloc to low velocity. these behavior are all describ by compact expressions, call constitut relations, whose one-dimension form are given here: j = \u2212 d \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202 x (fick law of diffusion) q = \u2212 k t \u2202 t \u2202 x (fourier law of heat conduction) \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y (newton law of viscosity) {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf {j} &=-d{\\frac {\\partial \\rho }{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fick law of {q} &=-k_{t}{\\frac {\\partial t}{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fouri law of heat &=\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}}&&{\\text{(newton law of viscosity)}}\\end{aligned}}} where \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } is the density, j {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {j} } and q {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {q} } are the mass and heat fluxes, and d {\\displaystyl d} and k t {\\displaystyl k_{t}} are the mass diffus and thermal conductivity. the fact that mass, momentum, and energi (heat) transport are among the most relev process in continuum mechan is not a coincidence: these are among the few physic quantiti that are conserv at the microscop level in interparticl collisions. thus, rather than be dictat by the fast and complex microscop interact timescale, their dynam occur on macroscop timescales, as describ by the various equat of transport theori and hydrodynamics. == newtonian and non-newtonian fluid == newton law of viscos is not a fundament law of nature, but rather a constitut equat (like hook law, fick law, and ohm law) which serv to defin the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it form is motiv by experi which show that for a wide rang of fluids, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is independ of strain rate. such fluid are call newtonian. gases, water, and mani common liquid can be consid newtonian in ordinari condit and contexts. however, there are mani non-newtonian fluid that signific deviat from this behavior. for example: shear-thicken liquids, whose viscos increas with the rate of shear strain. shear-thin liquids, whose viscos decreas with the rate of shear strain. thixotrop liquids, that becom less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. rheopect (dilatant) liquids, that becom more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. bingham plastic that behav as a solid at low stress but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.trouton ratio is the ratio of extension viscos to shear viscosity. for a newtonian fluid, the trouton ratio is shear-thin liquid are veri commonly, but misleadingly, describ as thixotropic.even for a newtonian fluid, the viscos usual depend on it composit and temperature. for gase and other compress fluids, it depend on temperatur and vari veri slowli with pressure. the viscos of some fluid may depend on other factors. a magnetorheolog fluid, for example, becom thicker when subject to a magnet field, possibl to the point of behav like a solid. == in solid == the viscous forc that aris dure fluid flow must not be confus with the elast forc that aris in a solid in respons to shear, compress or extens stresses. while in the latter the stress is proport to the amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proport to the rate of deform over time. for this reason, maxwel use the term fugit elast for fluid viscosity. however, mani liquid (includ water) will briefli react like elast solid when subject to sudden stress. conversely, mani \"solids\" (even granite) will flow like liquids, albeit veri slowly, even under arbitrarili small stress. such materi are therefor best describ as possess both elast (reaction to deformation) and viscos (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, be viscoelastic. viscoelast solid may exhibit both shear viscos and bulk viscosity. the extension viscos is a linear combin of the shear and bulk viscos that describ the reaction of a solid elast materi to elongation. it is wide use for character polymers. in geology, earth materi that exhibit viscous deform at least three order of magnitud greater than their elast deform are sometim call rheids. == measur == viscos is measur with various type of viscomet and rheometers. a rheomet is use for fluid that cannot be defin by a singl valu of viscos and therefor requir more paramet to be set and measur than is the case for a viscometer. close temperatur control of the fluid is essenti to obtain accur measurements, particular in materi like lubricants, whose viscos can doubl with a chang of onli \u00b0c.for some fluids, the viscos is constant over a wide rang of shear rate (newtonian fluids). the fluid without a constant viscos (non-newtonian fluids) cannot be describ by a singl number. non-newtonian fluid exhibit a varieti of differ correl between shear stress and shear rate. one of the most common instrument for measur kinemat viscos is the glass capillari viscometer. in coat industries, viscos may be measur with a cup in which the efflux time is measured. there are sever sort of cup \u2013 such as the zahn cup and the ford viscos cup \u2013 with the usag of each type vari main accord to the industry. the efflux time can also be convert to kinemat viscos (centistokes, cst) through the convers equations. also use in coatings, a stormer viscomet use load-bas rotat in order to determin viscosity. the viscos is report in kreb unit (ku), which are uniqu to stormer viscometers. vibrat viscomet can also be use to measur viscosity. resonant, or vibrat viscomet work by creat shear wave within the liquid. in this method, the sensor is submerg in the fluid and is made to reson at a specif frequency. as the surfac of the sensor shear through the liquid, energi is lost due to it viscosity. this dissip energi is then measur and convert into a viscos reading. a higher viscos caus a greater loss of energy.extension viscos can be measur with various rheomet that appli extension stress. volum viscos can be measur with an acoust rheometer. appar viscos is a calcul deriv from test perform on drill fluid use in oil or gas well development. these calcul and test help engin develop and maintain the properti of the drill fluid to the specif required. nanoviscos (viscos sens by nanoprobes) can be measur by fluoresc correl spectroscopy. == unit == the si unit of dynam viscos is the newton-second per squar meter also frequent express in the equival form pascal-second (pa\u00b7s) and kilogram per meter per second the cgs unit is the pois (p, or = pa\u00b7s), name after jean l\u00e9onard mari poiseuille. it is common expressed, particular in astm standards, as centipois (cp), becaus it is more conveni (for instanc the viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cp), and one centipois is equal to the si millipasc second (mpa\u00b7s). the si unit of kinemat viscos is squar meter per second wherea the cgs unit for kinemat viscos is the stoke (st, or = name after sir georg gabriel stokes. in u.s. usage, stoke is sometim use as the singular form. the submultipl centistok (cst) is often use instead, cst = = the kinemat viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cst. the most frequent use system of us customary, or imperial, unit are the british gravit (bg) and english engin (ee). in the bg system, dynam viscos has unit of pound-second per squar foot and in the ee system it has unit of pound-force-second per squar foot note that the pound and pound-forc are equivalent; the two system differ onli in how forc and mass are defined. in the bg system the pound is a basic unit from which the unit of mass (the slug) is defin by newton second law, wherea in the ee system the unit of forc and mass (the pound-forc and pound-mass respectively) are defin independ through the second law use the proport constant gc. kinemat viscos has unit of squar feet per second in both the bg and ee systems. nonstandard unit includ the reyn, a british unit of dynam viscosity. in the automot industri the viscos index is use to describ the chang of viscos with temperature. the reciproc of viscos is fluidity, usual symbol by \u03d5 = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\phi } or f = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl } , depend on the convent used, measur in reciproc pois or sometim call the rhe. fluiditi is seldom use in engin practice. at one time the petroleum industri reli on measur kinemat viscos by mean of the saybolt viscometer, and express kinemat viscos in unit of saybolt univers second (sus). other abbrevi such as ssu (saybolt second universal) or suv (saybolt univers viscosity) are sometim used. kinemat viscos in centistok can be convert from sus accord to the arithmet and the refer tabl provid in astm d == molecular origin == in general, the viscos of a system depend in detail on how the molecul constitut the system interact. there are no simpl but correct express for the viscos of a fluid. the simplest exact express are the green\u2013kubo relat for the linear shear viscos or the transient time correl function express deriv by evan and morriss in although these express are each exact, calcul the viscos of a dens fluid use these relat current requir the use of molecular dynam comput simulations. on the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilut gas. even elementari assumpt about how gas molecul move and interact lead to a basic understand of the molecular origin of viscosity. more sophist treatment can be construct by systemat coarse-grain the equat of motion of the gas molecules. an exampl of such a treatment is chapman\u2013enskog theory, which deriv express for the viscos of a dilut gas from the boltzmann equation.momentum transport in gase is general mediat by discret molecular collisions, and in liquid by attract forc which bind molecul close together. becaus of this, the dynam viscos of liquid are typic much larger than those of gases. === pure gase === viscos in gase aris princip from the molecular diffus that transport momentum between layer of flow. an elementari calcul for a dilut gas at temperatur t {\\displaystyl t} and densiti \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c1 \u03bb k b t \u03c0 m , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\alpha \\rho \\lambda {\\sqrt {\\frac m}}},} where k b {\\displaystyl k_{\\text{b}}} is the boltzmann constant, m {\\displaystyl m} the molecular mass, and \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } a numer constant on the order of {\\displaystyl . the quantiti \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } , the mean free path, measur the averag distanc a molecul travel between collisions. even without a priori knowledg of \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , this express has interest implications. in particular, sinc \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is typic invers proport to densiti and increas with temperature, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } itself should increas with temperatur and be independ of densiti at fix temperature. in fact, both of these predict persist in more sophist treatments, and accur describ experiment observations. note that this behavior run counter to common intuit regard liquids, for which viscos typic decreas with temperature.for rigid elast sphere of diamet \u03c3 {\\displaystyl \\sigma } , \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } can be computed, give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c0 / k b m t \u03c3 . {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {\\alpha }{\\pi {\\sqrt {k_{\\text{b}}mt}}{\\sigma in this case \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is independ of temperature, so \u03bc \u221d t / {\\displaystyl \\mu \\propto . for more complic molecular models, however, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } depend on temperatur in a non-trivi way, and simpl kinet argument as use here are inadequate. more fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becom imprecis for particl that interact over a finit range, which limit the use of the concept for describ real-world gases. ==== chapman\u2013enskog theori ==== a techniqu develop by sydney chapman and david enskog in the earli allow a more refin calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is base on the boltzmann equation, which provid a systemat statist descript of a dilut gas in term of intermolecular interactions. as such, their techniqu allow accur calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } for more realist molecular models, such as those incorpor intermolecular attract rather than just hard-cor repulsion. it turn out that a more realist model of interact is essenti for accur predict of the temperatur depend of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which experi show increas more rapid than the t / {\\displaystyl trend predict for rigid elast spheres. indeed, the chapman\u2013enskog analysi show that the predict temperatur depend can be tune by vari the paramet in various molecular models. a simpl exampl is the sutherland model, which describ rigid elast sphere with weak mutual attraction. in such a case, the attract forc can be treat perturbatively, which lead to a particular simpl express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } : \u03bc = \u03c3 ( k b m t \u03c0 ) / ( + s t ) \u2212 , {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {k_{\\text{b}}mt}{\\pi where s {\\displaystyl s} is independ of temperature, be determin onli by the paramet of the intermolecular attraction. to connect with experiment, it is conveni to rewrit as \u03bc = \u03bc ( t t ) / t + s t + s , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\mu where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos at temperatur t {\\displaystyl . if \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is known from experi at t = t {\\displaystyl and at least one other temperature, then s {\\displaystyl s} can be calculated. it turn out that express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } obtain in this way are accur for a number of gase over a sizabl rang of temperatures. on the other hand, chapman & cowl argu that this success doe not impli that molecul actual interact accord to the sutherland model. rather, they interpret the predict for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } as a simpl interpol which is valid for some gase over fix rang of temperature, but otherwis doe not provid a pictur of intermolecular interact which is fundament correct and general. slight more sophist models, such as the lennard-jon potential, may provid a better picture, but onli at the cost of a more opaqu depend on temperature. in some system the assumpt of spheric symmetri must be abandon as well, as is the case for vapor with high polar molecul like ==== bulk viscos ==== in the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscos aris in gase whenev there are non-neglig relax timescal govern the exchang of energi between the translat energi of molecul and their intern energy, e.g. rotat and vibrational. as such, the bulk viscos is {\\displaystyl for a monatom ideal gas, in which the intern energi of molecul in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide, whose molecul possess both rotat and vibrat energy. === pure liquid === in contrast with gases, there is no simpl yet accur pictur for the molecular origin of viscos in liquids. at the simplest level of description, the relat motion of adjac layer in a liquid is oppos primarili by attract molecular forc act across the layer boundary. in this picture, one (correctly) expect viscos to decreas with increas temperature. this is becaus increas temperatur increas the random thermal motion of the molecules, which make it easier for them to overcom their attract interactions.build on this visualization, a simpl theori can be construct in analog with the discret structur of a solid: group of molecul in a liquid are visual as form \"cages\" which surround and enclos singl molecules. these cage can be occupi or unoccupied, and stronger molecular attract correspond to stronger cages. due to random thermal motion, a molecul \"hops\" between cage at a rate which vari invers with the strength of molecular attractions. in equilibrium these \"hops\" are not bias in ani direction. on the other hand, in order for two adjac layer to move relat to each other, the \"hops\" must be bias in the direct of the relat motion. the forc requir to sustain this direct motion can be estim for a given shear rate, lead to where n a {\\displaystyl n_{a}} is the avogadro constant, h {\\displaystyl h} is the planck constant, v {\\displaystyl v} is the volum of a mole of liquid, and t b {\\displaystyl t_{b}} is the normal boil point. this result has the same form as the widespread and accur empir relat where a {\\displaystyl a} and b {\\displaystyl b} are constant fit from data. on the other hand, sever author express caution with respect to this model. error as larg as can be encount use equat compar with fit equat to experiment data. more fundamentally, the physic assumpt under equat have been criticized. it has also been argu that the exponenti depend in equat doe not necessarili describ experiment observ more accur than simpler, non-exponenti expressions.in light of these shortcomings, the develop of a less ad hoc model is a matter of practic interest. forego simplic in favor of precision, it is possibl to write rigor express for viscos start from the fundament equat of motion for molecules. a classic exampl of this approach is irving\u2013kirkwood theory. on the other hand, such express are given as averag over multiparticl correl function and are therefor difficult to appli in practice. in general, empir deriv express (base on exist viscos measurements) appear to be the onli consist reliabl mean of calcul viscos in liquids. === mixtur and blend === ==== gaseous mixtur ==== the same molecular-kinet pictur of a singl compon gas can also be appli to a gaseous mixture. for instance, in the chapman\u2013enskog approach the viscos \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} of a binari mixtur of gase can be written in term of the individu compon viscos \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu , their respect volum fractions, and the intermolecular interactions. as for the single-compon gas, the depend of \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} on the paramet of the intermolecular interact enter through various collision integr which may not be express in term of elementari functions. to obtain usabl express for \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} which reason match experiment data, the collision integr typic must be evalu use some combin of analyt calcul and empir fitting. an exampl of such a procedur is the sutherland approach for the single-compon gas, discuss above. ==== blend of liquid ==== as for pure liquids, the viscos of a blend of liquid is difficult to predict from molecular principles. one method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theori present abov for a pure liquid. this can be done with vari level of sophistication. one use express result from such an analysi is the lederer\u2013roegi equat for a binari mixture: ln \u2061 \u03bc blend = x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc + \u03b1 x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\ln \\mu _{\\text{blend}}={\\frac \\mu {\\alpha \\mu where \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } is an empir parameter, and x , {\\displaystyl and \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu are the respect mole fraction and viscos of the compon liquids.sinc blend is an import process in the lubric and oil industries, a varieti of empir and proprieti equat exist for predict the viscos of a blend, besid those stem direct from molecular theory. === solut and suspens === ==== aqeuous solut ==== depend on the solut and rang of concentration, an aqueous electrolyt solut can have either a larger or smaller viscos compar with pure water at the same temperatur and pressure. for instance, a salin (sodium chloride) solut has viscos over time that of pure water, wherea a potassium iodid solut has viscos about time that of pure water. an ideal model of dilut electrolyt solut lead to the follow predict for the viscos \u03bc s {\\displaystyl \\mu _{s}} of a solution: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu {c}},} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the solvent, c {\\displaystyl c} is the concentration, and a {\\displaystyl a} is a posit constant which depend on both solvent and solut properties. however, this express is onli valid for veri dilut solutions, have c {\\displaystyl c} less than mol/l. for higher concentrations, addit term are necessari which account for higher-ord molecular correlations: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c + b c + c c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu where b {\\displaystyl b} and c {\\displaystyl c} are fit from data. in particular, a negat valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is abl to account for the decreas in viscos observ in some solutions. estim valu of these constant are shown below for sodium chlorid and potassium iodid at temperatur \u00b0c (mol = mole, l = liter). ==== suspens ==== in a suspens of solid particl (e.g. micron-s sphere suspend in oil), an effect viscos \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be defin in term of stress and strain compon which are averag over a volum larg compar with the distanc between the suspend particles, but small with respect to macroscop dimensions. such suspens general exhibit non-newtonian behavior. however, for dilut system in steadi flows, the behavior is newtonian and express for \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be deriv direct from the particl dynamics. in a veri dilut system, with volum fraction \u03d5 \u2272 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\lesssim , interact between the suspend particl can be ignored. in such a case one can explicit calcul the flow field around each particl independently, and combin the result to obtain \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} . for spheres, this result in the einstein equation: \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the suspend liquid. the linear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is a direct consequ of neglect interparticl interactions; in general, one will have \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where the coeffici b {\\displaystyl b} may depend on the particl shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks). experiment determin of the precis valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is difficult, however: even the predict b = / {\\displaystyl for sphere has not been conclus validated, with various experi find valu in the rang \u2272 b \u2272 {\\displaystyl b\\lesssim . this defici has been attribut to difficulti in control experiment conditions.in denser suspensions, \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} acquir a nonlinear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } , which indic the import of interparticl interactions. various analyt and semi-empir scheme exist for captur this regime. at the most basic level, a term quadrat in \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is ad to \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} : \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu and the coeffici b {\\displaystyl is fit from experiment data or approxim from the microscop theory. in general, however, one should be cautious in appli such simpl formula sinc non-newtonian behavior appear in dens suspens ( \u03d5 \u2273 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\gtrsim for spheres), or in suspens of elong or flexibl particles.ther is a distinct between a suspens of solid particles, describ above, and an emulsion. the latter is a suspens of tini droplets, which themselv may exhibit intern circulation. the presenc of intern circul can notic decreas the observ effect viscosity, and differ theoret or semi-empir model must be used. === amorph materi === in the high and low temperatur limits, viscous flow in amorph materi (e.g. in glass and melts) has the arrhenius form: \u03bc = a e q / ( r t ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu =ae^{q/(rt)},} where q is a relev activ energy, given in term of molecular parameters; t is temperature; r is the molar gas constant; and a is approxim a constant. the activ energi q take a differ valu depend on whether the high or low temperatur limit is be considered: it chang from a high valu qh at low temperatur (in the glassi state) to a low valu ql at high temperatur (in the liquid state). for intermedi temperatures, q {\\displaystyl q} vari nontrivi with temperatur and the simpl arrhenius form fails. on the other hand, the two-exponenti equat \u03bc = a t exp \u2061 ( b r t ) [ + c exp \u2061 ( d r t ) ] , {\\displaystyl \\mu =at\\exp \\left({\\frac \\left({\\frac {d}{rt}}\\right)\\right],} where a {\\displaystyl a} , b {\\displaystyl b} , c {\\displaystyl c} , d {\\displaystyl d} are all constants, provid a good fit to experiment data over the entir rang of temperatures, while at the same time reduc to the correct arrhenius form in the low and high temperatur limits. besid be a conveni fit to data, the express can also be deriv from various theoret model of amorph materi at the atom level.a two-exponenti equat for the viscos can be deriv within the dyre shove model of supercool liquids, where the arrhenius energi barrier is identifi with the high-frequ shear modulus time a characterist shove volume. upon specifi the temperatur depend of the shear modulus via thermal expans and via the repuls part of the intermolecular potential, anoth two-exponenti equat is retrieved: \u03bc = exp \u2061 { v c c g k b t exp \u2061 [ ( + \u03bb ) \u03b1 t t g ( \u2212 t t g ) ] } {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\exp {\\left\\{{\\frac {v_{c}c_{g}}{k_{b}t}}\\exp )\\alpha {t}{t_{g}}}\\right)\\right]}\\right\\}}} where c g {\\displaystyl c_{g}} denot the high-frequ shear modulus of the materi evalu at a temperatur equal to the glass transit temperatur t g {\\displaystyl t_{g}} , v c {\\displaystyl v_{c}} is the so-cal shove volume, i.e. it is the characterist volum of the group of atom involv in the shove event by which an atom/molecul escap from the cage of nearest-neighbours, typic on the order of the volum occupi by few atoms. furthermore, \u03b1 t {\\displaystyl \\alpha _{t}} is the thermal expans coeffici of the material, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is a paramet which measur the steep of the power-law rise of the ascend flank of the first peak of the radial distribut function, and is quantit relat to the repuls part of the interatom potential. finally, k b {\\displaystyl k_{b}} denot the boltzmann constant. === eddi viscos === in the studi of turbul in fluids, a common practic strategi is to ignor the small-scal vortic (or eddies) in the motion and to calcul a large-scal motion with an effect viscosity, call the \"eddi viscosity\", which character the transport and dissip of energi in the smaller-scal flow (see larg eddi simulation). in contrast to the viscos of the fluid itself, which must be posit by the second law of thermodynamics, the eddi viscos can be negative. == select substanc == observ valu of viscos vari over sever order of magnitude, even for common substanc (see the order of magnitud tabl below). for instance, a sucros (sugar) solut has a viscos over time that of water, and time that of air. more dramatically, pitch has been estim to have a viscos billion time that of water. === water === the dynam viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } of water is about mpa\u00b7 at room temperatur \u00b0c). as a function of temperatur in kelvins, the viscos can be estim use the semi-empir vogel-fulcher-tammann equation: \u03bc = a exp \u2061 ( b t \u2212 c ) {\\displaystyl \\mu =a\\exp \\left({\\frac {b}{t-c}}\\right)} where a = mpa\u00b7s, b = k, and c = k. experiment determin valu of the viscos are also given in the tabl below. note that at \u00b0c the dynam viscos is about cp and the kinemat viscos is about cst. === air === under standard atmospher condit \u00b0c and pressur of bar), the dynam viscos of air is \u03bcpa\u00b7s, rough time smaller than the viscos of water at the same temperature. except at veri high pressure, the viscos of air depend most on the temperature. among the mani possibl approxim formula for the temperatur depend (see temperatur depend of viscosity), one is: \u03b7 air = \u22c5 \u2212 \u22c5 t {\\displaystyl \\eta which is accur in the rang \u00b0c to \u00b0c. for this formula to be valid, the temperatur must be given in kelvins; \u03b7 air {\\displaystyl \\eta _{\\text{air}}} then correspond to the viscos in pa\u00b7s. === other common substanc === === order of magnitud estim === the follow tabl illustr the rang of viscos valu observ in common substances. unless otherwis noted, a temperatur of \u00b0c and a pressur of atmospher are assumed. certain substanc of variabl composit or with non-newtonian

    "in chemistri the amount of substanc in a given sampl of matter is defin as the number of discret atom scale particl in it divid by the avogadro constant na in a truli atomist view the amount of substanc is simpli the number of particl that constitut the substanc the particl or entiti may be molecul atom ion electron or other depend on the context the valu of the avogadro constant na has been defin as mol in the truli atomist view mol particl the avogadro number and therefor the convers constant is simpli na the amount of substanc is sometim refer to as the chemic amount the mole symbol mol is a unit of amount of substanc in the intern system of unit defin sinc by fix the avogadro constant at the given valu histor the mole was defin as the amount of substanc in gram of the isotope. as a consequence, the mass of one mole of a chemic compound, in grams, is numer equal (for all practic purposes) to the mass of one molecul of the compound, in daltons, and the molar mass of an isotop in gram per mole is equal to the mass number. for example, a molecul of water has a mass of about dalton on average, wherea a mole of water (which contain water molecules) has a total mass of about grams. in chemistry, becaus of the law of multipl proportions, it is often much more conveni to work with amount of substanc (that is, number of mole or of molecules) than with mass (grams) or volum (liters). for example, the chemic fact molecul of oxygen will react with molecul of hydrogen to make molecul of water can also be state as mole of will react with mole of to form mole of water\". the same chemic fact, express in term of masses, would be g mole) of oxygen will react with approxim g mole of hydrogen to make approxim g moles) of water\" (and the number would depend on the isotop composit of the reagents). in term of volume, the number would depend on the pressur and temperatur of the reagent and products. for the same reasons, the concentr of reagent and product in solut are often specifi in mole per liter, rather than gram per liter. the amount of substanc is also a conveni concept in thermodynamics. for example, the pressur of a certain quantiti of a nobl gas in a recipi of a given volume, at a given temperature, is direct relat to the number of molecul in the gas (through the ideal gas law), not to it mass. this technic sens of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confus with the general sens of \"amount\" in the english language. the latter may refer to other measur such as mass or volume, rather than the number of particles. there are propos to replac \"amount of substance\" with more easily-distinguish terms, such as enplethi and stoichiometr amount.th iupac recommend that \"amount of substance\" should be use instead of \"number of moles\", just as the quantiti mass should not be call \"number of kilograms\". == natur of the particl == to avoid ambiguity, the natur of the particl should be specifi in ani measur of the amount of substance: thus, mol of molecul of oxygen is about grams, wherea mol of atom of oxygen (o) is about grams. == deriv quantiti == === molar quantiti (per mole) === the quotient of some extens physic quantiti of a homogen sampl by it amount of substanc is an intens properti of the substance, usual name by the prefix molar.for example, the ratio of the mass of a sampl by it amount of substanc is the molar mass, whose si unit is kilogram (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about g/mol for water, and g/mol for iron. from the volume, one get the molar volume, which is about milliliter/mol for liquid water and ml/mol for iron at room temperature. from the heat capacity, one get the molar heat capacity, which is about j/k/mol for water and about j/k/mol for iron. === amount concentr (mole per liter) === anoth import deriv quantiti is the amount of substanc concentr (also call amount concentration, or substanc concentr in clinic chemistry; which is defin as the amount of a specif substanc in a sampl of a solut (or some other mixture), divid by the volum of the sample. the si unit of this quantiti is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution). thus, for example, the amount concentr of sodium chlorid in ocean water is typic about mol/l. the denomin is the volum of the solution, not of the solvent. thus, for example, one liter of standard vodka contain about l of ethanol g, mol) and l of water. the amount concentr of ethanol is therefor mol of l of vodka) = mol/l, not mol of l of water), which would be mol/l. in chemistry, it is customari to read the unit \"mol/l\" as molar, and denot it by the symbol \"m\" (both follow the numer value). thus, for example, each liter of a molar\" or m\" solut of urea in water contain mole of that molecule. by extension, the amount concentr is also common call the molar of the substanc of interest in the solution. however, as of may these term and symbol are not condon by iupac.thi quantiti should not be confus with the mass concentration, which is the mass of the substanc of interest divid by the volum of the solut (about g/l for sodium chlorid in ocean water). === amount fraction (mole per mole) === confusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguish from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of mole (molecules) of the substanc of interest divid by the total number of mole (molecules) in the solut sample. this quantiti is more proper call the amount fraction. == histori == the alchemists, and especi the earli metallurgists, probabl had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviv record of ani general of the idea beyond a set of recipes. in mikhail lomonosov question the idea that mass was the onli measur of the quantiti of matter, but he did so onli in relat to his theori on gravitation. the develop of the concept of amount of substanc was coincident with, and vital to, the birth of
