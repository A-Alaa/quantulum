        "text": "The minute is a unit of time usually equal to 1/60 (the first sexagesimal fraction) of an hour, or 60 seconds. In the UTC time standard, a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds (there is a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system). Although not an SI unit, the minute is accepted for use with SI units. The SI symbol for minute or minutes is min (without a dot). The prime symbol is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time.\n\n\n== History ==\nAl-Biruni first subdivided the hour sexagesimally into minutes, seconds, thirds and fourths in 1000 CE while discussing Jewish months. Around 1235 John of Sacrobosco continued this tradition, although Oxford University historian Philipp Nothaft thought Sacrobosco was the first to do so.Historically, the word \"minute\" comes from the Latin pars minuta prima, meaning \"first small part\".  This division of the hour can be further refined with a \"second small part\" (Latin: pars minuta secunda), and this is where the word \"second\" comes from.  For even further refinement, the term \"third\" (1\u204460 of a second) remains in some languages, for example Polish (tercja) and Turkish (salise), although most modern usage subdivides seconds by using decimals.  The symbol notation of the prime for minutes and double prime for seconds can be seen as indicating the first and second cut of the hour (similar to how the foot is the first cut of the yard or perhaps chain, with inches as the second cut).  In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon, writing in Latin, defined the division of time between full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (horae, minuta, secunda, tertia, and quarta) after noon on specified calendar dates. The introduction of the minute hand into watches was possible only after the invention of the hairspring by Thomas Tompion, an English watchmaker, in 1675.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInternational System of Units\nLatitude and longitude\nOrders of magnitude (time)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHenry Campbell Black, Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, entry on Minute.

        "text": "The second (symbol: s, abbreviation: sec) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) (French: Syst\u00e8me International d\u2019unit\u00e9s), commonly understood and historically defined as 1\u204486400 of a day \u2013 this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each. Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces, representing seconds (and minutes), and a \"second hand\" to mark the passage of time in seconds.  Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter. The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for speed, meters per second per second for acceleration, and cycles per second for frequency.\n\nAlthough the historical definition of the unit was based on this division of the Earth's rotation cycle, the formal definition in the International System of Units (SI) is a much steadier timekeeper:The second is defined as being equal to the time duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the fundamental unperturbed ground-state of the caesium-133 atom.\nBecause the Earth's rotation varies and is also slowing ever so slightly, a leap second is periodically added to clock time to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation.\nMultiples of seconds are usually counted in hours and minutes. Fractions of a second are usually counted in tenths or hundredths. In scientific work, small fractions of a second are counted in milliseconds (thousandths), microseconds (millionths), nanoseconds (billionths), and sometimes smaller units of a second. An everyday experience with small fractions of a second is a 1-gigahertz microprocessor which has a cycle time of 1 nanosecond. Camera shutter speeds are often expressed in fractions of a second, such as 1\u204430 second or 1\u20441000 second.\nSexagesimal divisions of the day from a calendar based on astronomical observation have existed since the third millennium BC, though they were not seconds as we know them today. Small divisions of time could not be measured back then, so such divisions were mathematically derived. The first timekeepers that could count seconds accurately were pendulum clocks invented in the 17th century. Starting in the 1950s, atomic clocks became better timekeepers than Earth's rotation, and they continue to set the standard today.\n\n\n== Clocks and solar time ==\nA mechanical clock, one which does not depend on measuring the relative rotational position of the Earth, keeps uniform time called mean time, within whatever accuracy is intrinsic to it. That means that every second, minute and every other division of time counted by the clock will be the same duration as any other identical division of time. But a sundial which measures the relative position of the sun in the sky called apparent time, does not keep uniform time.  The time kept by a sundial varies by time of year, meaning that seconds, minutes and every other division of time is a different duration at different times of the year. The time of day measured with mean time versus apparent time may differ by as much as 15 minutes, but a single day will differ from the next by only a small amount; 15 minutes is a cumulative difference over a part of the year. The effect is due chiefly to the obliqueness of Earth's axis with respect to its orbit around the sun.\nThe difference between apparent solar time and mean time was recognized by astronomers since antiquity, but prior to the invention of accurate mechanical clocks in the mid-17th century, sundials were the only reliable timepieces, and apparent solar time was the only generally accepted standard.\n\n\n== Events and units of time in seconds ==\nFractions of a second are usually denoted in decimal notation, for example 2.01 seconds, or two and one hundredth seconds. Multiples of seconds are usually expressed as minutes and seconds, or hours, minutes and seconds of clock time, separated by colons, such as 11:23:24, or 45:23 (the latter notation can give rise to ambiguity, because the same notation is used to denote hours and minutes). It rarely makes sense to express longer periods of time like hours or days in seconds, because they are awkwardly large numbers. For the metric unit of second, there are decimal prefixes representing 10\u221224 to 1024 seconds.\nSome common units of time in seconds are: a minute is 60 seconds; an hour is 3,600 seconds; a day is 86,400 seconds; a week is 604,800 seconds; a year (other than leap years) is 31,536,000 seconds; and a (Gregorian) century averages 3,155,695,200 seconds; with all of the above excluding any possible leap seconds.\nSome common events in seconds are: a stone falls about 4.9 meters from rest in one second; a pendulum of length about one meter has a swing of one second, so pendulum clocks have pendulums about a meter long; the fastest human sprinters run 10 meters in a second; an ocean wave in deep water travels about 23 meters in one second; sound travels about 343 meters in one second in air; light takes 1.3 seconds to reach Earth from the surface of the Moon, a distance of 384,400 kilometers.\n\n\n== Other units incorporating seconds ==\nA second is part of other units, such as frequency measured in hertz (inverse seconds or second\u22121), speed (meters per second) and acceleration (meters per second squared).  The metric system unit becquerel, a measure of radioactive decay, is measured in inverse seconds.  The meter is defined in terms of the speed of light and the second; definitions of the metric base units kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and candela also depend on the second. The only base unit whose definition does not depend on the second is the mole. Of the 22 named derived units of the SI, only two (radian and steradian), do not depend on the second.  Many derivative units for everyday things are reported in terms of larger units of time, not seconds, such as clock time in hours and minutes, velocity of a car in kilometers per hour or miles per hour, kilowatt hours of electricity usage, and speed of a turntable in rotations per minute.\n\n\n== Timekeeping standards ==\nA set of atomic clocks throughout the world keeps time by consensus: the clocks \"vote\" on the correct time, and all voting clocks are steered to agree with the consensus, which is called International Atomic Time (TAI). TAI \"ticks\" atomic seconds.Civil time is defined to agree with the rotation of the Earth. The international standard for timekeeping is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This time scale \"ticks\" the same atomic seconds as TAI, but inserts or omits leap seconds as necessary to correct for variations in the rate of rotation of the Earth.A time scale in which the seconds are not exactly equal to atomic seconds is UT1, a form of universal time. UT1 is defined by the rotation of the Earth with respect to the sun, and does not contain any leap seconds. UT1 always differs from UTC by less than a second.\n\n\n== Optical lattice clock ==\n\nWhile they are not yet part of any timekeeping standard, optical lattice clocks with frequencies in the visible light spectrum now exist and are the most accurate timekeepers of all.  A strontium clock with frequency 430 THz, in the red range of visible light, now holds the accuracy record: it will gain or lose less than a second in 15 billion years, which is longer than the estimated age of the universe. Such a clock can measure a change in its elevation of as little as 2 cm by the change in its rate due to gravitational time dilation.\n\n\n== History of definition ==\n\nThere have only ever been three definitions of the second: as a fraction of the day, as a fraction of an extrapolated year, and as the microwave frequency of a caesium atomic clock, and they have realized a sexagesimal division of the day from ancient astronomical calendars.\n\n\n=== Sexagesimal divisions of calendar time and day ===\nCivilizations in the classic period and earlier created divisions of the calendar as well as arcs using a sexagesimal system of counting, so at that time the second was a sexagesimal subdivision of the day (ancient second = day/60\u00d760), not of the hour like the modern second (= hour/60\u00d760).  Sundials and water clocks were among the earliest timekeeping devices, and units of time were measured in degrees of arc.  Conceptual units of time smaller than realizable on sundials were also used.\nThere are references to 'second' as part of a lunar month in the writings of natural philosophers of the Middle Ages, which were mathematical subdivisions that could not be measured mechanically.\n\n\n=== Fraction of solar day ===\nThe earliest mechanical clocks  which appeared starting in the 14th century had displays that divided the hour into halves, thirds, quarters and sometimes even 12 parts, but never by 60. In fact, the hour was not commonly divided in 60 minutes as it was not uniform in duration. It was not practical for timekeepers to consider minutes until the first mechanical clocks that displayed minutes appeared near the end of the 16th century. Mechanical clocks kept the mean time, as opposed to the apparent time displayed by sundials. \nBy that time, sexagesimal divisions of time were well established in Europe.The earliest clocks to display seconds appeared during the last half of the 16th century. The second became accurately measurable with the development of mechanical clocks. The earliest spring-driven timepiece with a second hand which marked seconds is an unsigned clock depicting Orpheus in the Fremersdorf collection, dated between 1560 and 1570. During the 3rd quarter of the 16th century, Taqi al-Din built a clock with marks every 1/5 minute.\nIn 1579, Jost B\u00fcrgi built a clock for William of Hesse that marked seconds. In 1581, Tycho Brahe redesigned clocks that had displayed only minutes at his observatory so they also displayed seconds, even though those seconds were not accurate. In 1587, Tycho complained that his four clocks disagreed by plus or minus four seconds.In 1656, Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens invented the first pendulum clock. It had a pendulum length of just under a meter which gave it a swing of one second, and an escapement that ticked every second. It was the first clock that could accurately keep time in seconds. By the 1730s, 80 years later, John Harrison's maritime chronometers could keep time accurate to within one second in 100 days.\nIn 1832, Gauss proposed using the second as the base unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second system of units. The British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) in 1862 stated that \"All men of science are agreed to use the second of mean solar time as the unit of time.\" BAAS formally proposed the CGS system in 1874, although this system was gradually replaced over the next 70 years by MKS units. Both the CGS and MKS systems used the same second as their base unit of time. MKS was adopted internationally during the 1940s, defining the second as 1\u204486,400 of a mean solar day.\n\n\n=== Fraction of an ephemeris year ===\n\nSome time in the late 1940s, quartz crystal oscillator clocks with an operating frequency of ~100 kHz advanced to keep time with accuracy better than 1 part in 108 over an operating period of a day. It became apparent that a consensus of such clocks kept better time than the rotation of the Earth. Metrologists also knew that Earth's orbit around the Sun (a year) was much more stable than Earth's rotation. This led to proposals as early as 1950 to define the second as a fraction of a year.\nThe Earth's motion was described in Newcomb's Tables of the Sun (1895), which provided a formula for estimating the motion of the Sun relative to the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892. This resulted in adoption of an ephemeris time scale expressed in units of the sidereal year at that epoch by the IAU in 1952. This extrapolated timescale brings the observed positions of the celestial bodies into accord with Newtonian dynamical theories of their motion. In 1955, the tropical year, considered more fundamental than the sidereal year, was chosen by the IAU as the unit of time. The tropical year in the definition was not measured but calculated from a formula describing a mean tropical year that decreased linearly over time.\nIn 1956, the second was redefined in terms of a year relative to that epoch. The second was thus defined as \"the fraction 1\u204431,556,925.9747 of the tropical year for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time\". This definition was adopted as part of the International System of Units in 1960.\n\n\n=== \"Atomic\" second ===\nBut even the best mechanical, electric motorized and quartz crystal-based clocks develop discrepancies from environmental conditions. Far better for timekeeping is the natural and exact \"vibration\" in an energized atom. The frequency of vibration (i.e., radiation) is very specific depending on the type of atom and how it is excited. Since 1967, the second has been defined as exactly \"the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom\" (at a temperature of 0 K). This length of a second was selected to correspond exactly to the length of the ephemeris second previously defined. Atomic clocks use such a frequency to measure seconds by counting cycles per second at that frequency. Radiation of this kind is one of the most stable and reproducible phenomena of nature. The current generation of atomic clocks is accurate to within one second in a few hundred million years.\nAtomic clocks now set the length of a second and the time standard for the world.\n\n\n== SI multiples ==\n\nSI prefixes are commonly used for times shorter than one second, but rarely for multiples of a second. Instead, certain non-SI units are permitted for use in SI: minutes, hours, days, and in astronomy Julian years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrders of magnitude (time)\nSeconds pendulum\nTime standard\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Physical Laboratory: Trapped ion optical frequency standards \nHigh-accuracy strontium ion optical clock; National Physical Laboratory (2005)\nNational Research Council of Canada: Optical frequency standard based on a single trapped ion\nNIST: Definition of the second; notice the cesium atom must be in its ground state at 0 K\nOfficial BIPM definition of the second\nThe leap second: its history and possible future\nWhat is a Cesium atom clock?\nAccuracy of the time \u2014 Astronoo\nSLAC: Scales of Time - Our universe from 10^18 to 10^-18 seconds",

        "clean": "Amount of substance",
        "text": "In chemistry, the amount of substance in a given sample of matter is defined as the number of discrete atomic-scale particles in it divided by the Avogadro constant NA. In a truly atomistic view, the amount of substance is simply the number of particles that constitute the substance. The particles or entities may be molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, or other, depending on the context. The value of the Avogadro constant NA has been defined as 6.02214076\u00d71023 mol\u22121. In the truly atomistic view, 1 mol = 6.02214076\u00d71023 particles (the Avogadro number)  and therefore the conversion constant is simply NA = 1. The amount of substance is sometimes referred to as the chemical amount.\nThe mole (symbol: mol) is a unit of amount of substance in the International System of Units, defined (since 2019) by fixing the Avogadro constant at the given value.  Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a chemical compound, in grams, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in daltons, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015  daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains 6.02214076\u00d71023 water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\nIn chemistry, because of the law of multiple proportions, it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of oxygen (O2) will react with 2 molecules of hydrogen (H2) to make 2 molecules of water (H2O)\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of O2 will react with 2 moles of H2 to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g  (1 mole) of oxygen  will react with approximately 4.0304 g (2 moles of H2) hydrogen to make approximately 36.0304 g (2 moles) of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the isotopic composition of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in thermodynamics.  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a noble gas in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the ideal gas law), not to its mass.\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the English language. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume, rather than the number of particles. There are proposals to replace \"amount of substance\" with more easily-distinguishable terms, such as enplethy  and stoichiometric amount.The IUPAC recommends that \"amount of substance\" should be used instead of \"number of moles\", just as the quantity mass should not be called \"number of kilograms\".\n\n\n== Nature of the particles ==\nTo avoid ambiguity, the nature of the particles should be specified in any measurement of the amount of substance: thus, 1 mol of molecules of oxygen (O2) is about 32 grams, whereas 1 mol of atoms of oxygen (O) is about 16 grams.\n\n\n== Derived quantities ==\n\n\n=== Molar quantities (per mole) ===\nThe quotient of some extensive physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an intensive property of the substance, usually named by the prefix molar.For example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the molar mass, whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for iron.  From the volume, one gets the molar volume, which is about 17.962 milliliter/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the heat capacity, one gets the molar heat capacity, which is about 75.385 J/K/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n\n=== Amount concentration (moles per liter) ===\nAnother important derived quantity is the amount of substance concentration (also called amount concentration, or substance concentration in clinical chemistry; which is defined as the amount of a specific substance in a sample of a solution (or some other mixture), divided by the volume of the sample.\nThe SI unit of this quantity is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution).  Thus, for example, the amount concentration of sodium chloride in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard vodka contains about 0.40 L of ethanol (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L.\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as molar, and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of urea (CH4N2O) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the molarity of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.This quantity should not be confused with the mass concentration, which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water).\n\n\n=== Amount fraction (moles per mole) ===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the amount fraction.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe alchemists, and especially the early metallurgists, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, Mikhail Lomonosov questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter, but he did so only in relation to his theories on gravitation. The development of the concept of amount of substance was coincidental with, and vital to, the birth of modern chemistry.\n\n1777: Wenzel publishes Lessons on Affinity, in which he demonstrates that the proportions of the \"base component\" and the \"acid component\" (cation and anion in modern terminology) remain the same during reactions between two neutral salts.\n1789: Lavoisier publishes Treatise of Elementary Chemistry, introducing the concept of a chemical element and clarifying the Law of conservation of mass for chemical reactions.\n1792: Richter publishes the first volume of Stoichiometry or the Art of Measuring the Chemical Elements (publication of subsequent volumes continues until 1802). The term \"stoichiometry\" is used for the first time. The first tables of equivalent weights are published for acid\u2013base reactions. Richter also notes that, for a given acid, the equivalent mass of the acid is proportional to the mass of oxygen in the base.\n1794: Proust's Law of definite proportions generalizes the concept of equivalent weights to all types of chemical reaction, not simply acid\u2013base reactions.\n1805: Dalton publishes his first paper on modern atomic theory, including a \"Table of the relative weights of the ultimate particles of gaseous and other bodies\".The concept of atoms raised the question of their weight. While many were skeptical about the reality of atoms, chemists quickly found atomic weights to be an invaluable tool in expressing stoichiometric relationships.\n1808: Publication of Dalton's A New System of Chemical Philosophy, containing the first table of atomic weights (based on H = 1).\n1809: Gay-Lussac's Law of combining volumes, stating an integer relationship between the volumes of reactants and products in the chemical reactions of gases.\n1811: Avogadro hypothesizes that equal volumes of different gases (at same temperature and pressure) contain equal numbers of particles, now known as Avogadro's law.\n1813/1814: Berzelius publishes the first of several tables of atomic weights based on the scale of O = 100.\n1815: Prout publishes his hypothesis that all atomic weights are integer multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen.

However, this was not sufficient to convince all scientists of the existence of atoms and molecules, many considered it simply being a useful tool for calculation.\n1834: Faraday states his Laws of electrolysis, in particular that \"the chemical decomposing action of a current is constant for a constant quantity of electricity\".\n1856: Kr\u00f6nig derives the ideal gas law from kinetic theory.

The concurrent development of mass spectrometry, starting in 1886, supported the concept of atomic and molecular mass and provided a tool of direct relative measurement.\n1905: Einstein's paper on Brownian motion dispels any last doubts on the physical reality of atoms, and opens the way for an accurate determination of their mass.\n1909: Perrin coins the name Avogadro constant and estimates its value.\n1913: Discovery of isotopes of non-radioactive elements by Soddy and Thomson.\n1914: Richards receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for \"his determinations of the atomic weight of a large number of elements\".\n1920: Aston proposes the whole number rule, an updated version of Prout's hypothesis.\n1921: Soddy receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his work on the chemistry of radioactive substances and investigations into isotopes\".\n1922: Aston receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his whole-number rule\".\n1926: Perrin receives the Nobel Prize in Physics, in part for his work in measuring the Avogadro constant.\n1959/1960: Unified atomic mass unit scale based on 12C = 12 adopted by IUPAP and IUPAC.\n1968: The mole is recommended for inclusion in the International System of Units (SI) by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM).\n1972: The mole is approved as the SI base unit of amount of substance.\n2019: The mole is redefined in the SI as \"the amount of substance of a system that contains 6.02214076\u00d71023 specified elementary entities\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmount fraction\nInternational System of Quantities\n\n\n== References ==",

One litre of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 litre of solvent because the process of dissolution causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease. Sometimes the mass concentration is called titre.\n\n\n=== Notation ===\nThe notation common with mass density underlines the connection between the two quantities (the mass concentration being the mass density of a component in the solution), but it can be a source of confusion especially when they appear in the same formula undifferentiated by an additional symbol (like a star superscript, a bolded symbol or varrho).\n\n\n=== Dependence on volume ===\nMass concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion. On small intervals of temperature the dependence is :\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c1\n              \n                i\n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    T\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \u03b1\n              \u0394\n              T\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho _{i}={\\frac {\\rho _{i\\left(T_{0}\\right)}}{1+\\alpha \\Delta T}}}\n  where \u03c1i(T0) is the mass concentration at a reference temperature, \u03b1 is the thermal expansion coefficient of the mixture.\n\n\n=== Sum of mass concentrations - normalizing relation ===\nThe sum of the mass concentrations of all components (including the solvent) gives the density \u03c1 of the solution:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        =\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho =\\sum _{i}\\rho _{i}\\,}\n  Thus, for pure component the mass concentration equals the density of the pure component.\n\n\n== Units ==\nThe SI-unit for mass concentration is kg/m3 (kilogram/cubic metre). This is the same as mg/mL and g/L. Another commonly used unit is g/(100 mL), which is identical to g/dL (gram/decilitre).\n\n\n=== Usage in biology ===\nIn biology, the \"%\" symbol is sometimes incorrectly used to denote mass concentration, also called \"mass/volume percentage\". A solution with 1 g of solute dissolved in a final volume of 100 mL of solution would be labeled as \"1%\" or \"1% m/v\" (mass/volume). The notation is mathematically flawed because the unit \"%\" can only be used for dimensionless quantities. \"Percent solution\" or \"percentage solution\" are thus terms best reserved for \"mass percent solutions\" (m/m = m% = mass solute/mass total solution after mixing), or \"volume percent solutions\" (v/v = v% = volume solute per volume of total solution after mixing). The very ambiguous terms \"percent solution\" and \"percentage solutions\" with no other qualifiers, continue to occasionally be encountered.  \nThis common usage of % to mean m/v in biology is because of many biological solutions being dilute and water-based or an aqueous solution.  Liquid water has a density of approximately 1 g/cm3 (1 g/mL).  Thus 100 mL of water is equal to approximately 100 g.  Therefore, a solution with 1 g of solute dissolved in final volume of 100 mL aqueous solution may also be considered 1% m/m (1 g solute in 99 g water). This approximation breaks down as the solute concentration is increased (for example, in water\u2013NaCl mixtures). High solute concentrations are often not physiologically relevant, but are occasionally encountered in pharmacology, where the mass per volume notation is still sometimes encountered. An extreme example is saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) which attains 100 \"%\" m/v potassium iodide mass concentration (1 gram KI per 1 mL solution) only because the solubility of the dense salt KI is extremely high in water, and the resulting solution is very dense (1.72 times as dense as water).  \nAlthough there are examples to the contrary, it should be stressed that the commonly used \"units\" of % w/v are grams per millilitre (g/mL).  1% m/v solutions are sometimes thought of as being gram/100 mL but this detracts from the fact that % m/v is g/mL; 1 g of water has a volume of approximately 1 mL (at standard temperature and pressure) and the mass concentration is said to be 100%.  To make 10 mL of an aqueous 1% cholate solution, 0.1 grams of cholate are dissolved in 10 mL of water.  Volumetric flasks are the most appropriate piece of glassware for this procedure as deviations from ideal solution behavior can occur with high solute concentrations.\nIn solutions, mass concentration is commonly encountered as the ratio of mass/[volume solution], or m/v. In water solutions containing relatively small quantities of dissolved solute (as in biology), such figures may be \"percentivized\" by multiplying by 100 a ratio of grams solute per mL solution. The result is given as \"mass/volume percentage\". Such a convention expresses mass concentration of 1 gram of solute in 100 mL of solution, as \"1 m/v %\".\n\n\n== Related quantities ==\n\n\n=== Density of pure component ===\nThe relation between mass concentration and density of a pure component (mass concentration of single component mixtures) is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            \u2217\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              V\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            V\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho _{i}=\\rho _{i}^{*}{\\frac {V_{i}}{V}}\\,}\n  where \u03c1\u2217i is the density of the pure component, Vi the volume of the pure component before mixing.\n\n\n=== Specific volume (or mass-specific volume) ===\nSpecific volume is the inverse of mass concentration only in the case of pure substances, for which mass concentration is the same as the density of the pure-substance:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bd\n        =\n        \n          \n            V\n            m\n          \n        \n         \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \u03c1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu ={\\frac {V}{m}}\\ ={\\frac {1}{\\rho }}}\n  \n\n\n=== Molar concentration ===\nThe conversion to molar concentration ci is given by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c1\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            \n              M\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c_{i}={\\frac {\\rho _{i}}{M_{i}}}}\n  where Mi is the molar mass of constituent i.\n\n\n=== Mass fraction ===\nThe conversion to mass fraction wi is given by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c1\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            \u03c1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{i}={\\frac {\\rho _{i}}{\\rho }}}\n  \n\n\n=== Mole fraction ===\nThe conversion to mole fraction xi is given by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c1\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            \u03c1\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            M\n            \n              M\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{i}={\\frac {\\rho _{i}}{\\rho }}{\\frac {M}{M_{i}}}}\n  where M is the average molar mass of the mixture.\n\n\n=== Molality ===\nFor binary mixtures, the conversion to molality bi is given by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c1\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                M\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n              (\n              \u03c1\n              \u2212\n              \n                \u03c1\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b_{i}={\\frac {\\rho _{i}}{M_{i}(\\rho -\\rho _{i})}}}\n  \n\n\n== Spatial variation and gradient ==\nThe values of (mass and molar) concentration different in space triggers the phenomenon of diffusion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "text": "The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate. For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, syrup has a higher viscosity than water.Viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal frictional force that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a viscous fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some stress (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube. This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion. So for a tube with a constant rate of flow, the strength of the compensating force is proportional to the fluid's viscosity. \nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids. Otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity; such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as pitch, may appear to be a solid.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the Latin viscum (\"mistletoe\"). Viscum also referred to a viscous glue derived from mistletoe berries.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n\nIn materials science and engineering, one is often interested in understanding the forces or stresses involved in the deformation of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by Hooke's law, which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called elastic stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the rate of change of the deformation over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the distance the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how quickly the shearing occurs.\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar Couette flow.\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n   at the bottom to \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   at the top. Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a force resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   at the top. Moreover, the magnitude \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F}\n   of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   and the area \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  : \n\n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        A\n        \n          \n            u\n            y\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F=\\mu A{\\frac {u}{y}}.}\n  The proportionality factor \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, with units of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Pa\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          s\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Pa}}\\cdot {\\text{s}}}\n   (pascal-second), often simply referred to as the viscosity. \nThe ratio \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        \n          /\n        \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u/y}\n   is called the rate of shear deformation or shear velocity, and is the derivative of the fluid speed in the direction perpendicular to the plates (see illustrations to the right).

As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity. (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.)

Knowledge of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03ba\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n   is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2207\n        \u22c5\n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} =0}\n   and so the term containing \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03ba\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n   drops out. Moreover, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03ba\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n   is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n   in a monatomic ideal gas. One situation in which \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03ba\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n   can be important is the calculation of energy loss in sound and shock waves, described by Stokes' law of sound attenuation, since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n\n=== Kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is sometimes more convenient to work in terms of the kinematic viscosity (sometimes also called the momentum diffusivity), defined as the ratio of the viscosity \u03bc to the density of the fluid \u03c1. It is usually denoted by the Greek letter nu (\u03bd) and has dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          l\n          e\n          n\n          g\n          t\n          h\n          \n            )\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          \n            /\n          \n          t\n          i\n          m\n          e\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {(length)^{2}/time} }\n  :\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bd\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03bc\n            \u03c1\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu ={\\frac {\\mu }{\\rho }},}\n  in order to distinguish it from the dynamic viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  , which has dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          o\n          r\n          c\n          e\n          \u00d7\n          t\n          i\n          m\n          e\n          \n            /\n          \n          a\n          r\n          e\n          a\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {force\\times time/area} }\n  .\n\n\n== Momentum transport ==\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conductivity characterizes heat transport, and (mass) diffusivity characterizes mass transport. To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        (\n        \u2202\n        u\n        \n          /\n        \n        \u2202\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =\\mu (\\partial u/\\partial y)}\n  , the shear stress \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau }\n   has units equivalent to a momentum flux, i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau }\n   can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n   direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called constitutive relations, whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  J\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \u2212\n                D\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      \u03c1\n                    \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  (Fick's law of diffusion)\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  q\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \u2212\n                \n                  k\n                  \n                    t\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      T\n                    \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  (Fourier's law of heat conduction)\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \u03c4\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \u03bc\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      u\n                    \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      y\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  (Newton's law of viscosity)\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf {J} &=-D{\\frac {\\partial \\rho }{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)}}\\\\[5pt]\\mathbf {q} &=-k_{t}{\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)}}\\\\[5pt]\\tau &=\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\partial y}}&&{\\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}}\\end{aligned}}}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho }\n   is the density, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          J\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {J} }\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          q\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {q} }\n   are the mass and heat fluxes, and \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{t}}\n   are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity. The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n\n== Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids ==\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a constitutive equation (like Hooke's law, Fick's law, and Ohm's law) which serves to define the viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  . Its form is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called Newtonian. Gases, water, and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many non-Newtonian fluids that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\nShear-thickening liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\nShear-thinning liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\nThixotropic liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\nRheopectic (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\nBingham plastics that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.Trouton's ratio is the ratio of extensional viscosity to shear viscosity. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3. Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.Even for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other compressible fluids, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A magnetorheological fluid, for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a magnetic field, possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n\n== In solids ==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the elastic forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the rate of deformation over time. For this reason, Maxwell used the term fugitive elasticity for fluid viscosity.\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even granite) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress. Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being viscoelastic.\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The extensional viscosity is a linear combination of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\nIn geology, earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three orders of magnitude greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called rheids.\n\n\n== Measurement ==\n\nViscosity is measured with various types of viscometers and rheometers. A rheometer is used for fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to obtain accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5 \u00b0C.For some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates (Newtonian fluids). The fluids without a constant viscosity (non-Newtonian fluids) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\nIn coating industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the efflux time is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the Zahn cup and the Ford viscosity cup \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.Extensional viscosity can be measured with various rheometers that apply extensional stress.\nVolume viscosity can be measured with an acoustic rheometer.\nApparent viscosity is a calculation derived from tests performed on drilling fluid used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\nNanoviscosity (viscosity sensed by nanoprobes) can be measured by Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.\n\n\n== Units ==\nThe SI unit of dynamic viscosity is the newton-second per square meter (N\u00b7s/m2), also frequently expressed in the equivalent forms pascal-second (Pa\u00b7s) and kilogram per meter per second (kg\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7s\u22121). The CGS unit is the poise (P, or g\u00b7cm\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s), named after Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille. It is commonly expressed, particularly in ASTM standards, as centipoise (cP), because it is more convenient (for instance the viscosity of water at 20 \u00b0C is about 1 cP), and one centipoise is equal to the SI millipascal second (mPa\u00b7s).\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m2/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the stokes (St, or cm2\u00b7s\u22121 = 0.0001 m2\u00b7s\u22121), named after Sir George Gabriel Stokes. In U.S. usage, stoke is sometimes used as the singular form. The submultiple centistokes (cSt) is often used instead, 1 cSt = 1 mm2\u00b7s\u22121 = 10\u22126 m2\u00b7s\u22121. The kinematic viscosity of water at 20 \u00b0C is about 1 cSt.\nThe most frequently used systems of US customary, or Imperial, units are the British Gravitational (BG) and English Engineering (EE). In the BG system, dynamic viscosity has units of pound-seconds per square foot (lb\u00b7s/ft2), and in the EE system it has units of pound-force-seconds per square foot (lbf\u00b7s/ft2). Note that the pound and pound-force are equivalent; the two systems differ only in how force and mass are defined. In the BG system the pound is a basic unit from which the unit of mass (the slug) is defined by Newton's Second Law, whereas in the EE system the units of force and mass (the pound-force and pound-mass respectively) are defined independently through the Second Law using the proportionality constant gc.\nKinematic viscosity has units of square feet per second (ft2/s) in both the BG and EE systems.\nNonstandard units include the reyn, a British unit of dynamic viscosity. In the automotive industry the viscosity index is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\nThe reciprocal of viscosity is fluidity, usually symbolized by \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n        =\n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi =1/\\mu }\n   or \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F=1/\\mu }\n  , depending on the convention used, measured in reciprocal poise (P\u22121, or cm\u00b7s\u00b7g\u22121), sometimes called the rhe. Fluidity is seldom used in engineering practice.\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the Saybolt viscometer, and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of Saybolt universal seconds (SUS). Other abbreviations such as SSU (Saybolt seconds universal) or SUV (Saybolt universal viscosity) are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161.\n\n\n== Molecular origins ==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the Green\u2013Kubo relations for the linear shear viscosity or the transient time correlation function expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988. Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of molecular dynamics computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the equations of motion of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is Chapman\u2013Enskog theory, which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the Boltzmann equation.Momentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together. Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n\n=== Pure gases ===\n\nViscosity in gases arises principally from the molecular diffusion that transports momentum between layers of flow.

Even without a priori knowledge of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  , this expression has interesting implications. In particular, since \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bb\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   is typically inversely proportional to density and increases with temperature, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   itself should increase with temperature and be independent of density at fixed temperature. In fact, both of these predictions persist in more sophisticated treatments, and accurately describe experimental observations. Note that this behavior runs counter to common intuition regarding liquids, for which viscosity typically decreases with temperature.For rigid elastic spheres of diameter \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bb\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   can be computed, giving\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            \n              \u03c0\n              \n                3\n                \n                  /\n                \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                k\n                \n                  B\n                \n              \n              m\n              T\n            \n            \n              \u03c3\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu ={\\frac {\\alpha }{\\pi ^{3/2}}}{\\frac {\\sqrt {k_{\\text{B}}mT}}{\\sigma ^{2}}}.}\n  In this case \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bb\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   is independent of temperature, so \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        \u221d\n        \n          T\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu \\propto T^{1/2}}\n  .

More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.\n\n\n==== Chapman\u2013Enskog theory ====\n\nA technique developed by Sydney Chapman and David Enskog in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  .

Indeed, the Chapman\u2013Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model, which describes rigid elastic spheres with weak mutual attraction. In such a case, the attractive force can be treated perturbatively, which leads to a particularly simple expression for \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  :\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        =\n        \n          \n            5\n            \n              16\n              \n                \u03c3\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    k\n                    \n                      B\n                    \n                  \n                  m\n                  T\n                \n                \u03c0\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                \n                  S\n                  T\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu ={\\frac {5}{16\\sigma ^{2}}}\\left({\\frac {k_{\\text{B}}mT}{\\pi }}\\right)^{1/2}\\left(1+{\\frac {S}{T}}\\right)^{-1},}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n   is independent of temperature, being determined only by the parameters of the intermolecular attraction.

If \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   is known from experiments at \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        =\n        \n          T\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T=T_{0}}\n   and at least one other temperature, then \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n   can be calculated. It turns out that expressions for \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   obtained in this way are accurate for a number of gases over a sizable range of temperatures. On the other hand, Chapman & Cowling 1970 argue that this success does not imply that molecules actually interact according to the Sutherland model. Rather, they interpret the prediction for \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the Lennard-Jones potential, may provide a better picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature. In some systems the assumption of spherical symmetry must be abandoned as well, as is the case for vapors with highly polar molecules like H2O.\n\n\n==== Bulk viscosity ====\nIn the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their internal energy, e.g. rotational and vibrational. As such, the bulk viscosity is \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n   for a monatomic ideal gas, in which the internal energy of molecules in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide, whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational energy.\n\n\n=== Pure liquids ===\n\nIn contrast with gases, there is no simple yet accurate picture for the molecular origins of viscosity in liquids.\nAt the simplest level of description, the relative motion of adjacent layers in a liquid is opposed primarily by attractive molecular forces\nacting across the layer boundary. In this picture, one (correctly) expects viscosity to decrease with increasing temperature. This is because\nincreasing temperature increases the random thermal motion of the molecules, which makes it easier for them to overcome their attractive interactions.Building on this visualization, a simple theory can be constructed in analogy with the discrete structure of a solid: groups of molecules in a liquid \nare visualized as forming \"cages\" which surround and enclose single molecules. These cages can be occupied or unoccupied, and\nstronger molecular attraction corresponds to stronger cages.\nDue to random thermal motion, a molecule \"hops\" between cages at a rate which varies inversely with the strength of molecular attractions. In equilibrium these \"hops\" are not biased in any direction.\nOn the other hand, in order for two adjacent layers to move relative to each other, the \"hops\" must be biased in the direction\nof the relative motion. The force required to sustain this directed motion can be estimated for a given shear rate, leading to\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          N\n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N_{A}}\n   is the Avogadro constant, \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   is the Planck constant, \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n   is the volume of a mole of liquid, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{b}}\n   is the normal boiling point. This result has the same form as the widespread and accurate empirical relation\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n   are constants fit from data. On the other hand, several authors express caution with respect to this model.\nErrors as large as 30% can be encountered using equation (1), compared with fitting equation (2) to experimental data. More fundamentally, the physical assumptions underlying equation (1) have been criticized. It has also been argued that the exponential dependence in equation (1) does not necessarily describe experimental observations more accurately than simpler, non-exponential expressions.In light of these shortcomings, the development of a less ad hoc model is a matter of practical interest.\nForegoing simplicity in favor of precision, it is possible to write rigorous expressions for viscosity starting from the fundamental equations of motion for molecules. A classic example \nof this approach is Irving\u2013Kirkwood theory. On the other hand, such expressions\nare given as averages over multiparticle correlation functions and are therefore difficult to apply in practice.\nIn general, empirically derived expressions (based on existing viscosity measurements) appear to be the only consistently reliable means of calculating viscosity in liquids.\n\n\n=== Mixtures and blends ===\n\n\n==== Gaseous mixtures ====\nThe same molecular-kinetic picture of a single component gas can also be applied to a gaseous mixture. For instance, in the Chapman\u2013Enskog approach the viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            mix\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{mix}}}\n   of a binary mixture of gases can be written in terms of the individual component viscosities \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            1\n            ,\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{1,2}}\n  , their respective volume fractions, and the intermolecular interactions. As for the single-component gas, the dependence of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            mix\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{mix}}}\n   on the parameters of the intermolecular interactions enters through various collisional integrals which may not be expressible in terms of elementary functions. To obtain usable expressions for \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            mix\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{mix}}}\n   which reasonably match experimental data, the collisional integrals typically must be evaluated using some combination of analytic calculation and empirical fitting. An example of such a procedure is the Sutherland approach for the single-component gas, discussed above.\n\n\n==== Blends of liquids ====\nAs for pure liquids, the viscosity of a blend of liquids is difficult to predict from molecular principles. One method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theory presented above for a pure liquid. This can be done with varying levels of sophistication.

For instance, a 20% saline (sodium chloride) solution has viscosity over 1.5 times that of pure water, whereas a 20% potassium iodide solution has viscosity about 0.91 times that of pure water.\nAn idealized model of dilute electrolytic solutions leads to the following prediction for the viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            s\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{s}}\n   of a solution:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u03bc\n              \n                s\n              \n            \n            \n              \u03bc\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        +\n        A\n        \n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu _{0}}}=1+A{\\sqrt {c}},}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{0}}\n   is the viscosity of the solvent, \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c}\n   is the concentration, and \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   is a positive constant which depends on both solvent and solute properties.

Such suspensions generally exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. However, for dilute systems in steady flows, the behavior is Newtonian and expressions for \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            eff\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{eff}}}\n   can be derived directly from the particle dynamics. In a very dilute system, with volume fraction \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n        \u2272\n        0.02\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi \\lesssim 0.02}\n  , interactions between the suspended particles can be ignored.

This deficiency has been attributed to difficulty in controlling experimental conditions.In denser suspensions, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            eff\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{eff}}}\n   acquires a nonlinear dependence on \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  , which indicates the importance of interparticle interactions.

In general, however, one should be cautious in applying such simple formulas since non-Newtonian behavior appears in dense suspensions (\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n        \u2273\n        0.25\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi \\gtrsim 0.25}\n   for spheres), or in suspensions of elongated or flexible particles.There is a distinction between a suspension of solid particles, described above, and an emulsion. The latter is a suspension of tiny droplets, which themselves may exhibit internal circulation. The presence of internal circulation can noticeably decrease the observed effective viscosity, and different theoretical or semi-empirical models must be used.\n\n\n=== Amorphous materials ===\n\nIn the high and low temperature limits, viscous flow in amorphous materials (e.g. in glasses and melts) has the Arrhenius form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        =\n        A\n        \n          e\n          \n            Q\n            \n              /\n            \n            (\n            R\n            T\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu =Ae^{Q/(RT)},}\n  where Q is a relevant activation energy, given in terms of molecular parameters; T is temperature; R is the molar gas constant; and A is approximately a constant.

In contrast to the viscosity of the fluid itself, which must be positive by the second law of thermodynamics, the eddy viscosity can be negative.\n\n\n== Selected substances ==\n\nObserved values of viscosity vary over several orders of magnitude, even for common substances (see the order of magnitude table below). For instance, a 70% sucrose (sugar) solution has a viscosity over 400 times that of water, and 26000 times that of air. More dramatically, pitch has been estimated to have a viscosity 230 billion times that of water.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe dynamic viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   of water is about 0.89 mPa\u00b7s at room temperature (25 \u00b0C).

Experimentally determined values of the viscosity are also given in the table below. Note that at 20 \u00b0C the dynamic viscosity is about 1 cP and the kinematic viscosity is about 1 cSt.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nUnder standard atmospheric conditions (25 \u00b0C and pressure of 1 bar), the dynamic viscosity of air is 18.5 \u03bcPa\u00b7s, roughly 50 times smaller than the viscosity of water at the same temperature. Except at very high pressure, the viscosity of air depends mostly on the temperature.

For this formula to be valid, the temperature must be given in kelvins; \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b7\n          \n            air\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta _{\\text{air}}}\n   then corresponds to the viscosity in Pa\u00b7s.\n\n\n=== Other common substances ===\n\n\n=== Order of magnitude estimates ===\nThe following table illustrates the range of viscosity values observed in common substances. Unless otherwise noted, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C and a pressure of 1 atmosphere are assumed. Certain substances of variable composition or with non-Newtonian behavior are not assigned precise values, since in these cases viscosity depends on additional factors besides temperature and pressure.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nFluid properties \u2013 high accuracy calculation of viscosity for frequently encountered pure liquids and gases\nGas viscosity calculator as function of temperature\nAir viscosity calculator as function of temperature and pressure\nFluid Characteristics Chart \u2013 a table of viscosities and vapor pressures for various fluids\nGas Dynamics Toolbox \u2013 calculate coefficient of viscosity for mixtures of gases\nGlass Viscosity Measurement \u2013 viscosity measurement, viscosity units and fixpoints, glass viscosity calculation\nKinematic Viscosity \u2013 conversion between kinematic and dynamic viscosity\nPhysical Characteristics of Water \u2013 a table of water viscosity as a function of temperature\nVogel\u2013Tammann\u2013Fulcher Equation Parameters\nCalculation of temperature-dependent dynamic viscosities for some common components\n\"Test Procedures for Testing Highway and Nonroad Engines and Omnibus Technical Amendments\" \u2013 United States Environmental Protection Agency\nArtificial viscosity\nViscosity of Air, Dynamic and Kinematic, Engineers Edge",

        "text": "In physics and mechanics, torque is the rotational equivalent of linear force. It is also referred to as the moment, moment of force, rotational force or turning effect, depending on the field of study.  The concept originated with the studies by Archimedes of the usage of levers. Just as a linear force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object around a specific axis. Another definition of torque is the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance of the line of action of a force from the axis of rotation.

When being referred to as moment of force, it is commonly denoted by M.\nIn three dimensions, the torque is a pseudovector; for point particles, it is given by the cross product of the position vector (distance vector) and the force vector. The magnitude of torque of a rigid body depends on three quantities: the force applied, the lever arm vector connecting the point about which the torque is being measured to the point of force application, and the angle between the force and lever arm vectors.

For more on the units of torque, see Units.\n\n\n== Defining terminology ==\n\nJames Thomson, the brother of Lord Kelvin, introduced the term torque into English scientific literature in 1884. However, torque is referred to using different vocabulary depending on geographical location and field of study. This article follows the definition used in US physics in its usage of the word torque. In the UK and in US mechanical engineering, torque is referred to as moment of force, usually shortened to moment. These terms are interchangeable in US physics and UK physics terminology, unlike in US mechanical engineering, where the term torque is used for the closely related \"resultant moment of a couple\".\n\n\n=== Torque and moment in the US mechanical engineering terminology ===\nIn US mechanical engineering, torque is defined mathematically as the rate of change of angular momentum of an object (in physics it is called \"net torque\"). The definition of torque states that one or both of the angular velocity or the moment of inertia of an object are changing. Moment is the general term used for the tendency of one or more applied forces to rotate an object about an axis, but not necessarily to change the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is called torque in physics).\nFor example, a rotational force applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a torque. By contrast, a lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a bending moment), but since the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bending moment is not called a torque. Similarly with any force couple on an object that has no change to its angular momentum, such moment is also not called a torque.\n\n\n== Definition and relation to angular momentum ==\n\nA force applied perpendicularly to a lever multiplied by its distance from the lever's fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two meters from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the right hand grip rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled from the direction of the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.More generally, the torque on a point particle (which has the position r in some reference frame) can be defined as the cross product:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          F\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}=\\mathbf {r} \\times \\mathbf {F} ,}\n  where r is the particle's position vector relative to the fulcrum, and F is the force acting on the particle. The magnitude \u03c4 of the torque is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        r\n        F\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u03b8\n        ,\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =rF\\sin \\theta ,\\!}\n  where r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the particle, F is the magnitude of the force applied, and \u03b8 is the angle between the position and force vectors. Alternatively,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        r\n        \n          F\n          \n            \u22a5\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =rF_{\\perp },}\n  where F\u22a5 is the amount of force directed perpendicularly to the position of the particle. Any force directed parallel to the particle's position vector does not produce a torque.It follows from the properties of the cross product that the torque vector is perpendicular to both the position and force vectors. Conversely, the torque vector defines the plane in which the position and force vectors lie. The resulting torque vector direction is determined by the right-hand rule.The net torque on a body determines the rate of change of the body's angular momentum,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              \n                L\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              t\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {L} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}}\n  where L is the angular momentum vector and t is time.\nFor the motion of a point particle,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n        \n        =\n        I\n        \n          \u03c9\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {L} =I{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }},}\n  where I is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the orbital angular velocity pseudovector.

This equation is the rotational analogue of Newton's Second Law for point particles, and is valid for any type of trajectory. Note that although force and acceleration are always parallel and directly proportional, the torque \u03c4 need not be parallel or directly proportional to the angular acceleration \u03b1. This arises from the fact that although mass is always conserved, the moment of inertia in general is not.\n\n\n=== Proof of the equivalence of definitions ===\nThe definition of angular momentum for a single point particle is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          p\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {L} =\\mathbf {r} \\times {\\boldsymbol {p}}}\n  where p is the particle's linear momentum and r is the position vector from the origin.

Similarly, the proof can be generalized to a continuous mass by applying the above proof to each point within the mass, and then integrating over the entire mass.\n\n\n== Units ==\nTorque has the dimension of force times distance, symbolically L2MT\u22122. Although those fundamental dimensions are the same as that for energy or work, official SI literature suggests using the unit newton metre (N\u22c5m) and never the joule. The unit newton metre is properly denoted N\u22c5m.The traditional Imperial and U.S. customary units for torque are the pound foot (lbf-ft), or for small values the pound inch (lbf-in). Confusingly, in US practice torque is most commonly referred to as the foot-pound (denoted as either lb-ft or ft-lb) and the inch-pound (denoted as in-lb). Practitioners depend on context and the hyphen in the abbreviation to know that these refer to torque and not to energy or moment of mass (as the symbolism ft-lb would properly imply).\n\n\n== Special cases and other facts ==\n\n\n=== Moment arm formula ===\n\nA very useful special case, often given as the definition of torque in fields other than physics, is as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        (\n        \n          moment arm\n        \n        )\n        (\n        \n          force\n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =({\\text{moment arm}})({\\text{force}}).}\n  The construction of the \"moment arm\" is shown in the figure to the right, along with the vectors r and F mentioned above. The problem with this definition is that it does not give the direction of the torque but only the magnitude, and hence it is difficult to use in three-dimensional cases. If the force is perpendicular to the displacement vector r, the moment arm will be equal to the distance to the centre, and torque will be a maximum for the given force. The equation for the magnitude of a torque, arising from a perpendicular force:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        (\n        \n          distance to centre\n        \n        )\n        (\n        \n          force\n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =({\\text{distance to centre}})({\\text{force}}).}\n  For example, if a person places a force of 10 N at the terminal end of a wrench that is 0.5 m long (or a force of 10 N exactly 0.5 m from the twist point of a wrench of any length), the torque will be 5 N\u22c5m \u2013 assuming that the person moves the wrench by applying force in the plane of movement and perpendicular to the wrench.\n\n\n=== Static equilibrium ===\nFor an object to be in static equilibrium, not only must the sum of the forces be zero, but also the sum of the torques (moments) about any point. For a two-dimensional situation with horizontal and vertical forces, the sum of the forces requirement is two equations: \u03a3H = 0 and \u03a3V = 0, and the torque a third equation: \u03a3\u03c4 = 0. That is, to solve statically determinate equilibrium problems in two-dimensions, three equations are used.\n\n\n=== Net force versus torque ===\nWhen the net force on the system is zero, the torque measured from any point in space is the same. For example, the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field is the same regardless of your point of reference.

Internal-combustion engines produce useful torque only over a limited range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000\u20136,000 rpm for a small car). One can measure the varying torque output over that range with a dynamometer, and show it as a torque curve.\nSteam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints). Reciprocating steam-engines and electric motors can start heavy loads from zero rpm without a clutch.\n\n\n== Relationship between torque, power, and energy ==\nIf a force is allowed to act through a distance, it is doing mechanical work. Similarly, if torque is allowed to act through a rotational distance, it is doing work. Mathematically, for rotation about a fixed axis through the center of mass, the work W can be expressed as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        W\n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n

Note that the power injected by the torque depends only on the instantaneous angular speed \u2013 not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remains constant while the torque is being applied (this is equivalent to the linear case where the power injected by a force depends only on the instantaneous speed \u2013 not on the resulting acceleration, if any).\nIn practice, this relationship can be observed in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.\nConsistent units must be used. For metric SI units, power is watts, torque is newton metres and angular speed is radians per second (not rpm and not revolutions per second).\nAlso, the unit newton metre is dimensionally equivalent to the joule, which is the unit of energy. However, in the case of torque, the unit is assigned to a vector, whereas for energy, it is assigned to a scalar. This means that the dimensional equivalence of the newton metre and the joule may be applied in the former, but not in the latter case. This problem is addressed in orientational analysis which treats radians as a base unit rather than a dimensionless unit.\n\n\n=== Conversion to other units ===\nA conversion factor may be necessary when using different units of power or torque.  For example, if rotational speed (revolutions per time) is used in place of angular speed (radians per time), we multiply by a factor of 2\u03c0 radians per revolution.

        "clean": "Density",
        "text": "The density (more precisely, the volumetric mass density; also known as specific mass), of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is \u03c1 (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        =\n        \n          \n            m\n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho ={\\frac {m}{V}}}\n  where \u03c1 is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate \u2013 this quantity is more specifically called specific weight.\nFor a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration.\nDifferent materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure.\nTo simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one relative to water means that the substance floats in water.\nThe density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material.\nThe reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, Archimedes was given the task of determining whether King Hiero's goldsmith was embezzling gold during the manufacture of a golden wreath dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another, cheaper alloy. Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled, Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the displacement of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, \"Eureka! Eureka!\" (\u0395\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1! Greek \"I have found it\"). As a result, the term \"eureka\" entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.\nThe story first appeared in written form in Vitruvius' books of architecture, two centuries after it supposedly took place. Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time.From the equation for density (\u03c1 = m/V), mass density has units of mass divided by volume. As there are many units of mass and volume covering many different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use. The SI unit of kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3) and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm3) are probably the most commonly used units for density. One g/cm3 is equal to 1000 kg/m3.  One cubic centimetre (abbreviation cc) is equal to one millilitre. In industry, other larger or smaller units of mass and or volume are often more practical and US customary units may be used. See below for a list of some of the most common units of density.\n\n\n== Measurement of density ==\nA number of techniques as well as standards exist for the measurement of density of materials. Such techniques include the use of a hydrometer (a buoyancy method for liquids), Hydrostatic balance (a buoyancy method for liquids and solids), immersed body method (a buoyancy method for liquids), pycnometer (liquids and solids), air comparison pycnometer (solids), oscillating densitometer (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids). However, each individual method or technique measures different types of density (e.g. bulk density, skeletal density, etc.), and therefore it is necessary to have an understanding of the type of density  being measured as well as the type of material in question. \n\n\n=== Homogeneous materials ===\nThe density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a scale or balance; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymeter or a Coriolis flow meter may be used, respectively. Similarly, hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.\n\n\n=== Heterogeneous materials ===\nIf the body is not homogeneous, then its density varies between different regions of the object. In that case the density around any given location is determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location. In the limit of an infinitesimal volume the density of an inhomogeneous object at a point becomes: \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              r\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        d\n        m\n        \n          /\n        \n        d\n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho ({\\vec {r}})=dm/dV}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dV}\n   is an elementary volume at position \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  . The mass of the body then can be expressed as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        \u03c1\n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              r\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        \n        d\n        V\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m=\\int _{V}\\rho ({\\vec {r}})\\,dV.}\n  \n\n\n=== Non-compact materials ===\nIn practice, bulk materials such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. Many materials exist in nature as flakes, pellets, or granules.\nVoids are regions which contain something other than the considered material.  Commonly the void is air, but it could also be vacuum,  liquid, solid, or a different gas or gaseous mixture.\nThe bulk volume of a material\u2014inclusive of the void fraction\u2014is often obtained by a simple measurement (e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup) or geometrically from known dimensions.\nMass divided by bulk volume determines bulk density.  This is not the same thing as volumetric mass density.\nTo determine volumetric mass density, one must first discount the volume of the void fraction. Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning.  For the close-packing of equal spheres the non-void fraction can be at most about 74%.  It can also be determined empirically.  Some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a variable void fraction which depends on how the material is agitated or poured. It might be loose or compact, with more or less air space depending on handling.\nIn practice, the void fraction is not necessarily air, or even gaseous.  In the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantageous for measurement as the void fraction for sand saturated in water\u2014once any air bubbles are thoroughly driven out\u2014is potentially more consistent than dry sand measured with an air void.\nIn the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample. If the material is under pressure (commonly ambient air pressure at the earth's surface) the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was conducted. In the case of dry sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyancy effect is commonly neglected (less than one part in one thousand).\nMass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction, if the difference in density of the two voids materials is reliably known.\n\n\n== Changes of density ==\n\nIn general, density can be changed by changing either the pressure or the temperature. Increasing the pressure always increases the density of a material. Increasing the temperature generally decreases the density, but there are notable exceptions to this generalization. For example, the density of water increases between its melting point at 0 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C; similar behavior is observed in silicon at low temperatures.\nThe effect of pressure and temperature on the densities of liquids and solids is small. The compressibility for a typical liquid or solid is 10\u22126 bar\u22121 (1 bar = 0.1 MPa) and a typical thermal expansivity is 10\u22125 K\u22121. This roughly translates into needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure to reduce the volume of a substance by one percent. (Although the pressures needed may be around a thousand times smaller for sandy soil and some clays.) A one percent expansion of volume typically requires a temperature increase on the order of thousands of degrees Celsius.\nIn contrast, the density of gases is strongly affected by pressure. The density of an ideal gas is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              M\n              P\n            \n            \n              R\n              T\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho ={\\frac {MP}{RT}},}\n  where M is the molar mass, P is the pressure, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. This means that the density of an ideal gas can be doubled by doubling the pressure, or by halving the absolute temperature.\nIn the case of volumic thermal expansion at constant pressure and small intervals of temperature the temperature dependence of density is :\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c1\n              \n                \n                  T\n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \u03b1\n              \u22c5\n              \u0394\n              T\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho ={\\frac {\\rho _{T_{0}}}{1+\\alpha \\cdot \\Delta T}}}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            \n              T\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho _{T_{0}}}\n   is the density at a reference temperature, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n   is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material at temperatures close to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{0}}\n  .\n\n\n== Density of solutions ==\nThe density of a solution is the sum of mass (massic) concentrations of the components of that solution.\nMass (massic) concentration of each given component \u03c1i in a solution sums to density of the solution.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        =\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03f1\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho =\\sum _{i}\\varrho _{i}\\,}\n  Expressed as a function of the densities of pure components of the mixture and their volume participation, it allows the determination of excess molar volumes:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        =\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              V\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            V\n          \n        \n        \n        =\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03c6\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              V\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \u2211\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n              \n                V\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n              +\n              \n                \u2211\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    V\n                    \n                      E\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho =\\sum _{i}\\rho _{i}{\\frac {V_{i}}{V}}\\,=\\sum _{i}\\rho _{i}\\varphi _{i}=\\sum _{i}\\rho _{i}{\\frac {V_{i}}{\\sum _{i}V_{i}+\\sum _{i}{V^{E}}_{i}}}}\n  provided that there is no interaction between the components.\nKnowing the relation between excess volumes and activity coefficients of the  components, one can determine the activity coefficients.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                V\n                \n                  E\n                \n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        R\n        T\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              ln\n              \u2061\n              \n                \u03b3\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              P\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overline {V^{E}}}_{i}=RT{\\frac {\\partial \\ln \\gamma _{i}}{\\partial P}}}\n  \n\n\n== Densities ==\n\n\n=== Various materials ===\nSelected chemical elements are listed here.

The density of precious metals could conceivably be based on Troy ounces and pounds, a possible cause of confusion.\nKnowing the volume of the unit cell of a crystalline material and its formula weight (in daltons), the density can be calculated. One dalton per cubic \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is equal to a density of 1.660 539 066 60 g/cm3.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Density\" .

        "text": "The foot (pl. feet), standard symbol: ft, is a unit of length in the British imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. The prime symbol, \u2032, is a customarily used alternative symbol. Since the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959, one foot is defined as 0.3048 meters exactly. In customary and imperial units, one foot comprises 12 inches and one yard comprises three feet.\nHistorically the \"foot\" was a part of many local systems of units, including the Greek, Roman, Chinese, French, and English systems. It varied in length from country to country, from city to city, and sometimes from trade to trade. Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally, but not always, subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits.\nThe United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot (a customary unit of length) in preference to the meter in its commercial, engineering, and standards activities. The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom; road signs must use imperial units (however, distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards, not feet), while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height. The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement. The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world.\nThe length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 (UK), 14 (US male), 15.5 (US female) or 48 (EU sizing).\n\n\n== Historical origin ==\n\nHistorically, the human body has been used to provide the basis for units of length. The foot of an adult Caucasian male is typically about 15.3% of his height, giving a person of 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) a foot-length of about 268 mm (10.6 in), on average.\nArchaeologists believe that the Egyptians, Ancient Indians and Mesopotamians preferred the cubit while the Romans and the Greeks preferred the foot. Under the Harappan linear measures, Indus cities during the Bronze Age used a foot of  33.35 cm (13.2 in) and a cubit of 52.83 cm (20.8 in). The Egyptian equivalent of the foot\u2014a measure of four palms or 16 digits\u2014was known as the djeser and has been reconstructed as about 30 cm (11.8 in).\nThe Greek foot (\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2, pous) had a length of 1\u2044600 of a stadion, one stadion being about 181.2 m (594 ft), therefore a foot being at the time about 302 mm (11.9 in). Its exact size varied from city to city and could range between 270 mm (10.6 in) and 350 mm (13.8 in), but lengths used for temple construction appear to have been about 295 mm (11.6 in) to 325 mm (12.8 in), the former being close to the size of the Roman foot.\nThe standard Roman foot  (pes) was normally about 295.7 mm (11.6 in) (97% of today's measurement), but in the provinces, the so-called pes Drusianus (foot of Nero Claudius Drusus) was used, with a length of about 334 mm (13.1 in). (In reality, this foot predated Drusus.)Originally both the Greeks and the Romans subdivided the foot into 16 digits, but in later years, the Romans also subdivided the foot into 12 unciae (from which both the English words \"inch\" and \"ounce\" are derived).\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, some Roman traditions were continued but others fell into disuse. In AD 790 Charlemagne attempted to reform the units of measure in his domains. His units of length were based on the toise and in particular the toise de l'\u00c9critoire, the distance between the fingertips of the outstretched arms of a man. The toise has 6 pieds (feet) each of 326.6 mm (12.9 in).\nHe was unsuccessful in introducing a standard unit of length throughout his realm: an analysis of the measurements of Charlieu Abbey shows that during the 9th century the Roman foot of 296.1 mm (11.66 in) was used; when it was rebuilt in the 10th century, a foot of about 320 mm (12.6 in) was used. At the same time, monastic buildings used the Carolingian foot of 340 mm (13.4 in).The procedure for verification of the foot as described in the 16th century posthumously published work by Jacob K\u00f6bel in his book Geometrei. Von k\u00fcnstlichem Feldmessen und absehen is:\nStand at the door of a church on a Sunday and bid 16 men to stop, tall ones and small ones, as they happen to pass out when the service is finished; then make them put their left feet one behind the other, and the length thus obtained shall be a right and lawful rood to measure and survey the land with, and the 16th part of it shall be the right and lawful foot.\n\n\n=== England ===\n\nThe Neolithic long foot, first proposed by archeologists Mike Parker Pearson and Andrew Chamberlain, is based upon calculations from surveys of Phase 1 elements at Stonehenge. They found that the underlying diameters of the stone circles had been consistently laid out using  multiples of a base unit amounting to 30 long feet, which they calculated to be 1.056 of a modern international foot (thus 12.672 inches or 0.3219 m). Furthermore, this unit is identifiable in the dimensions of some stone lintels at the site and in the diameter of the \"southern circle\"  at nearby Durrington Walls. Evidence that this unit was in widespread use across southern Britain is available from the Folkton Drums from  Yorkshire (neolithic artifacts, made from chalk, with circumferences that exactly divide as integers into ten long feet) and a similar object, the Lavant drum, excavated at Lavant, Sussex, again with a circumference divisible as a whole number into ten long feet.The measures of Iron Age Britain are uncertain and proposed reconstructions such as the Megalithic Yard are controversial. Later Welsh legend credited Dyfnwal Moelmud with the establishment of their units, including a foot of 9 inches. The Belgic or North German foot of 335 mm (13.2 in) was introduced to England either by the Belgic Celts during their invasions prior to the Romans or by the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th and 6th century.\nRoman units were introduced following their invasion in AD 43. Following the Roman withdrawal and Saxon invasions, the Roman foot continued to be used in the construction crafts while the Belgic foot was used for land measurement. Both the Welsh and Belgic feet seem to have been based on multiples of the barleycorn, but by as early as 950 the English kings seem to have (ineffectually) ordered measures to be based upon an iron yardstick at Winchester and then London. Henry I was said to have ordered a new standard to be based upon the length of his own arm and, by the c.\u20091300 Act concerning the Composition of Yards and Perches traditionally credited to Edward I or II, the statute foot was a different measure, exactly 10/11 of the old foot. The barleycorn, inch, ell, and yard were likewise shrunk, while rods and furlongs remained the same. The ambiguity over the state of the mile was resolved by the 1593 Act against Converting of Great Houses into Several Tenements and for Restraint of Inmates and Inclosures in and near about the City of London and Westminster, which codified the statute mile as comprising 5,280 feet. The differences among the various physical standard yards around the world, revealed by increasingly powerful microscopes, eventually led to the 1959 adoption of the international foot defined in terms of the meter.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\n\n=== International foot ===\nThe international yard and pound agreement of July 1959 defined the length of the international yard in the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations as exactly 0.9144 meters. Consequently, the international foot is defined to be equal to exactly 0.3048 meters. This was 2 ppm shorter than the previous U.S. definition and 1.7 ppm longer than the previous British definition.\n\n\n==== Symbol ====\nThe IEEE standard symbol for a foot is \"ft\". In some cases, the foot is denoted by a prime, often approximated by an apostrophe, and the inch by a double prime; for example, 2 feet 4 inches is sometimes denoted as 2\u2032 4\u2033.\n\n\n=== Imperial units ===\nIn Imperial units, the foot was defined as 1\u20443 yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter). The yard standards of the different Commonwealth countries were periodically compared with one another. The value of the United Kingdom primary standard of the yard was determined in terms of the meter by the National Physical Laboratory in 1964 to be 0.9143969 m, implying a pre-1959 UK foot of 0.3047990 m.\nThe UK adopted the international yard for all purposes through the Weights and Measures Act 1963, effective 1 January 1964.\n\n\n=== Survey foot ===\nWhen the international foot was defined in 1959, a great deal of survey data was already available based on the former definitions, especially in the United States and in India. The small difference between the survey foot and the international foot would not be detectable on a survey of a small parcel, but becomes significant for mapping, or when the state plane coordinate system (SPCS) is used in the US, because the origin of the system may be hundreds of thousands of feet (hundreds of miles) from the point of interest. Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted survey feet to distinguish them from the international foot. The United Kingdom was unaffected by this problem, as the retriangulation of Great Britain (1936\u201362) had been done in meters.\n\n\n==== U.S. survey foot ====\nIn the United States, the foot was defined as 12 inches, with the inch being defined by the Mendenhall Order of 1893 as 39.37 inches = 1 m (making a US foot exactly 1200\u20443937 meters, approximately 0.30480061 m). Out of 50 states and six other jurisdictions, 40 have legislated that surveying measures should be based on the U.S. survey foot, six have legislated that they be made on the basis of the international foot, and ten have not specified the conversion factor from metric units.State legislation is also important for determining the conversion factor to be used for everyday land surveying and real estate transactions, although the difference (2 ppm) is of no practical significance given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile).\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Geodetic Survey and the Department of Commerce's Office of the General Counsel are planning to phase out the US survey foot beginning in 2023.\n\n\n==== Indian survey foot ====\nThe Indian survey foot is defined as exactly 0.3047996 m, presumably derived from a measurement of the previous Indian standard of the yard. The current National Topographic Database of the Survey of India is based on the metric WGS-84 datum, which is also used by the Global Positioning System.\n\n\n== Historical use ==\n\n\n=== Metric foot ===\nAn ISO 2848 measure of 3 basic modules (30 cm) is called a \"metric foot\", but there were earlier distinct definitions of a metric foot during metrication in France and Germany.\n\n\n==== France ====\nIn 1799 the meter became the official unit of length in France. This was not fully enforced, and in 1812 Napoleon introduced the system of mesures usuelles which restored the traditional French measurements in the retail trade, but redefined them in terms of metric units. The foot, or pied m\u00e9trique, was defined as one third of a meter. This unit continued in use until 1837.\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nIn southwestern Germany in 1806, the Confederation of the Rhine was founded and three different reformed feet were defined, all of which were based on the metric system:\nIn Hesse, the Fu\u00df (foot) was redefined as 25 cm.\nIn Baden, the Fu\u00df was redefined as 30 cm.\nIn the Palatinate, the Fu\u00df was redefined as being 33+1\u20443 cm (as in France).\n\n\n=== Other obsolete feet ===\nPrior to the introduction of the metric system, many European cities and countries used the foot, but it varied considerably in length: the voet in Ieper, Belgium, was 273.8 millimeters (10.78 in) while the piede in Venice was 347.73 millimeters (13.690 in). Lists of conversion factors between the various units of measure were given in many European reference works including:\n\nTrait\u00e9, Paris \u2013 1769\nPalaiseau \u2013 Bordeaux: 1816 \nde Gelder, Amsterdam and The Hague \u2013 1824\nHorace, Brussels \u2013 1840\nNoback & Noback (2 volumes), Leipzig \u2013 1851\nBruhns, Leipzig \u2013 1881Many of these standards were peculiar to a particular city, especially in Germany (which, before German Unification in 1871, consisted of many kingdoms, principalities, free cities and so on). In many cases the length of the unit was not uniquely fixed: for example, the English foot was stated as 11 pouces 2.6 lignes (French inches and lines) by Picard, 11 pouces 3.11 lignes by Maskelyne and 11 pouces 3 lignes by D'Alembert.Most of the various feet in this list ceased to be used when the countries adopted the metric system. The Netherlands and modern Belgium adopted the metric system in 1817, having used the mesures usuelles under Napoleon and the newly formed German Empire adopted the metric system in 1871.The palm (typically 200 mm to 280 mm) was used in many Mediterranean cities instead of the foot. Horace Doursther, whose reference was published in Belgium which had the smallest foot measurements, grouped both units together, while J.F.G. Palaiseau devoted three chapters to units of length: one for linear measures (palms and feet), one for cloth measures (ells) and one for distances traveled (miles and leagues). In the table below, arbitrary cut-off points of 270 mm and 350 mm have been chosen.\n\n(In Belgium, the words pied (French) and voet (Dutch) would have been used interchangeably.)\n\n\n==== Notes ====\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnthropic units\nHistory of measurement\nInternational System of Units\nKorean units of measurement\nMermin's foot\nPous\nSystems of measurement\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "text": "In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object.  Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.\nCommon forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature.\nMass and energy are closely related. Due to mass\u2013energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough scale.\nLiving organisms require energy to stay alive, such as the energy humans get from food.  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy. The processes of Earth's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the Sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth.\n\n\n== Forms ==\n\nThe total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. Kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object \u2013 or the composite motion of the components of an object \u2013 and potential energy reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a field or may be stored in the field itself.\nWhile these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, macroscopic mechanical energy is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines potentials from the nuclear force and the weak force), among others.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word energy derives from the Ancient Greek: \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, romanized: energeia, lit.\u2009'activity, operation', which possibly appears for the first time in the work of Aristotle in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.\nIn the late 17th century, Gottfried Leibniz proposed the idea of the Latin: vis viva, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total vis viva was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, kinetic energy, differs from vis viva only by a factor of two.\nIn 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term \"energy\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense. Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \"kinetic energy\" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term \"potential energy\". The law of conservation of energy was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the caloric, or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum. In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.\nThese developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) as the field of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jo\u017eef Stefan. According to Noether's theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy, namely time.\n\n\n== Units of measure ==\n\nIn 1843, James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the \"Joule apparatus\": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer. It showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle.\nIn the International System of Units (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after Joule. It is a derived unit. It is equal to the energy expended (or work done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as ergs, calories, British Thermal Units, kilowatt-hours and kilocalories, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.\nThe SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the watt, which is a joule per second.  Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour.  The CGS energy unit is the erg and the imperial and US customary unit is the foot pound. Other energy units such as the electronvolt, food calorie or thermodynamic kcal (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and BTU are used in specific areas of science and commerce.\n\n\n== Scientific use ==\n\n\n=== Classical mechanics ===\n\nIn classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a conserved quantity. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.\nWork, a function of energy, is force times distance.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        W\n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            C\n          \n        \n        \n          F\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          d\n        \n        \n          s\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W=\\int _{C}\\mathbf {F} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {s} }\n  This says that the work (\n  \n    \n      \n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W}\n  ) is equal to the line integral of the force F along a path C; for details see the mechanical work article. Work and thus energy is frame dependent. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.\nThe total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph-Louis Lagrange. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).\nNoether's theorem (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.\n\n\n=== Chemistry ===\nIn the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular, or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be exothermic or exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endothermic reactions the situation is the reverse. Chemical reactions are usually not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E by the Boltzmann's population factor e\u2212E/kT \u2013 that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be provided in the form of thermal energy.\n\n\n=== Biology ===\n\nIn biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy used in respiration is mostly stored in molecular oxygen  and can be unlocked by reactions with molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins stored by cells. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 \u00f7 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum. The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a \"feel\" for the use of a given amount of energy.Sunlight's radiant energy is also captured by plants as chemical potential energy in photosynthesis, when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and high-energy compounds like oxygen  and ATP. Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins can release the energy of oxygen, which is utilized by living organisms as an electron acceptor. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when organic molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action.\nAny living organism relies on an external source of energy \u2013 radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants, chemical energy in some form in the case of animals \u2013 to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500\u20132000 Calories (6\u20138 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which glucose (C6H12O6) and stearin (C57H110O6) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              12\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            O\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          6\n          \n          \n            O\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \u27f6\n          6\n          \n          \n            CO\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          6\n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          O\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\ce {C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              57\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              110\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            O\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          81\n          \n          \u22c5\n          5\n          \n          \n            O\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \u27f6\n          57\n          \n          \n            CO\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          55\n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          O\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\ce {C57H110O6 + 81.5O2 -> 57CO2 + 55H2O}}}\n  and some of the energy is used to convert ADP into ATP.\n\nADP + HPO42\u2212 \u2192 ATP + H2OThe rest of the chemical energy in O2 and the carbohydrate or fat is converted into heat: the ATP is used as a sort of \"energy currency\", and some of the chemical energy it contains is used for other metabolism when ATP reacts with OH groups and eventually splits into ADP and phosphate (at each stage of a metabolic pathway, some chemical energy is converted into heat). Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:\ngain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100 m race: 4 kJ\ngain in gravitational potential energy of a 150 kg weight lifted through 2 metres: 3 kJ\nDaily food intake of a normal adult: 6\u20138 MJIt would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical or radiant energy), and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\"the surroundings\"). Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat.\n\n\n=== Earth sciences ===\nIn geology, continental drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth's interior, while meteorological phenomena like wind, rain, hail, snow, lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes are all a result of energy transformations brought about by solar energy on the atmosphere of the planet Earth.\nSunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.\nIn a slower process, radioactive decay of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives plate tectonics and may lift mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.\n\n\n=== Cosmology ===\nIn cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.\n\n\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\n\nIn quantum mechanics, energy is defined in terms of the energy operator\nas a time derivative of the wave function. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by Planck's relation: \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        =\n        h\n        \u03bd\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E=h\\nu }\n   (where \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   is Planck's constant and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bd\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu }\n   the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or photons.\n\n\n=== Relativity ===\nWhen calculating kinetic energy (work to accelerate a massive body from zero speed to some finite speed) relativistically \u2013 using Lorentz transformations instead of Newtonian mechanics \u2013 Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it rest energy: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{0}=mc^{2}}\n  ,where\n\nm is the mass of the body,\nc is the speed of light in vacuum,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{0}}\n   is the rest energy.For example, consider electron\u2013positron annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their rest mass) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the matter and antimatter (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles.  This is a reversible process \u2013 the inverse process is called pair creation \u2013 in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.\nIn general relativity, the stress\u2013energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.  This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system (\"mass manifestations\"), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating (\"energy manifestations\"), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.\nIn classical physics, energy is a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time. In special relativity energy is also a scalar (although not a Lorentz scalar but a time component of the energy\u2013momentum 4-vector). In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but not invariant with respect to rotations of spacetime (= boosts).\n\n\n== Transformation ==\n\nEnergy may be transformed between different forms at various efficiencies. Items that transform between these forms are called transducers. Examples of transducers include a battery, from chemical energy to electric energy; a dam: gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water (and the blades of a turbine) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric generator; or a heat engine, from heat to work.\nExamples of energy transformation include generating electric energy from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms nuclear potential energy to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as radiant energy.\nThere are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into work in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by Carnot's theorem and the second law of thermodynamics. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.\nEnergy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the Big Bang later being \"released\" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was originally \"stored\" in heavy isotopes (such as uranium and thorium), by nucleosynthesis, a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion, chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at maximum. At its lowest point the kinetic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no friction or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the pendulum would continue swinging forever.\nEnergy is also transferred from potential energy (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{p}}\n  ) to kinetic energy (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{k}}\n  ) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:\n\nThe equation can then be simplified further since \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        =\n        m\n        g\n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{p}=mgh}\n   (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        m\n        \n          v\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{k}={\\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}\n   (half mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          E\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          E\n          \n            t\n            o\n            t\n            a\n            l\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{p}+E_{k}=E_{total}}\n  .\n\n\n=== Conservation of energy and mass in transformation ===\nEnergy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in mass-energy equivalence. The formula E = mc\u00b2, derived by Albert Einstein (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by J.J. Thomson (1881), Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1900), Friedrich Hasen\u00f6hrl (1904) and others (see Mass-energy equivalence#History for further information).\nPart of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of matter may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c^{2}}\n   is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1 kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~\n  \n    \n      \n        9\n        \u00d7\n        \n          10\n          \n            16\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 9\\times 10^{16}}\n   joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in nuclear physics and particle physics.\n\n\n=== Reversible and non-reversible transformations ===\nThermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: reversible processes and irreversible processes. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).\nAs the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic heat death of the universe. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a heat engine, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less.\n\n\n== Conservation of energy ==\n\nThe fact that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed is called the law of conservation of energy.  In the form of the first law of thermodynamics, this states that a closed system's energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by work or heat, and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the available energy. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations. The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.\nRichard Feynman said during a 1961 lecture:\nThere is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law \u2013 it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.\nMost kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception) are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.This law is a fundamental principle of physics. As shown rigorously by Noether's theorem, the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.\nEach of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appears as system mass, whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.\nIn quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0394\n        E\n        \u0394\n        t\n        \u2265\n        \n          \n            \u210f\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta E\\Delta t\\geq {\\frac {\\hbar }{2}}}\n  which is similar in form to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since H and t are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).\nIn particle physics, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum, exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces (more accurately known as fundamental interactions). Virtual photons are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which results in Coulomb law), for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the Casimir force, for van der Waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena.\n\n\n== Energy transfer ==\n\n\n=== Closed systems ===\nEnergy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are closed to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by conservative forces over a distance is measured as the work the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called heat. Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of electromagnetic energy via photons, physical collisions which transfer kinetic energy, and the conductive transfer of thermal energy.\nEnergy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the first law:\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n   is the amount of energy transferred, \n  \n    \n      \n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W}\n    represents the work done on the system, and \n  \n    \n      \n        Q\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q}\n   represents the heat flow into the system. As a simplification, the heat term, \n  \n    \n      \n        Q\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q}\n  , is sometimes ignored, especially when the thermal efficiency of the transfer is high.\n\nThis simplified equation is the one used to define the joule, for example.\n\n\n=== Open systems ===\nBeyond the constraints of closed systems, open systems can gain or lose energy in association with matter transfer (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Denoting this energy by \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  , one may write\n\n\n== Thermodynamics ==\n\n\n=== Internal energy ===\nInternal energy is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.\n\n\n=== First law of thermodynamics ===\nThe first law of thermodynamics asserts that energy (but not necessarily thermodynamic free energy) is always conserved and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to pressure forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a gain in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n        \n        E\n        =\n        T\n        \n          d\n        \n        S\n        \u2212\n        P\n        \n          d\n        \n        V\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} E=T\\mathrm {d} S-P\\mathrm {d} V\\,}\n  ,where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of temperature T and entropy S (in which entropy increases and the change dS is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is P and volume V (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, dV, is negative when work is done on the system).\nThis equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as advection of any form of energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a closed system is expressed in a general form by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n        \n        E\n        =\n        \u03b4\n        Q\n        +\n        \u03b4\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} E=\\delta Q+\\delta W}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        Q\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta Q}\n   is the heat supplied to the system and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta W}\n   is the work applied to the system.\n\n\n=== Equipartition of energy ===\nThe energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator (a mass on a spring) is alternatively kinetic and potential energy. At two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called equipartition principle; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.\nThis principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy, called entropy. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available energy states that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between \"new\" and \"old\" degrees. This mathematical result is called the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics is valid only for systems which are near or in equilibrium state. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing system's behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of maximum entropy production. It states that nonequilibrium systems behave in such a way to maximize its entropy production.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Journals ===\nThe Journal of Energy History / Revue d'histoire de l'\u00e9nergie (JEHRHE), 2018- \n\n\n== External links ==\n\nEnergy at Curlie\nDifferences between Heat and Thermal energy \u2013 BioCab",

        "text": "The inch (symbol: in or \u2033) is a unit of length in the (British) imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. It is equal to 1\u204436 yard or 1\u204412 of a foot. Derived from the Roman uncia (\"twelfth\"), the word inch is also sometimes used to translate similar units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb.\nStandards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s, it has been based on the metric system and defined as exactly 25.4 mm.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe English word \"inch\" (Old English: ynce) was an early borrowing from Latin uncia (\"one-twelfth; Roman inch; Roman ounce\") not present in other Germanic languages. The vowel change from Latin /u/ to Old English /y/ (which became Modern English /\u026a/) is known as umlaut. The consonant change from the Latin /k/ (spelled c) to English /t\u0283/ is palatalisation. Both were features of Old English phonology; see Phonological history of Old English \u00a7 Palatalization and Germanic umlaut \u00a7 I-mutation in Old English for more information.\n\"Inch\" is cognate with \"ounce\" (Old English: ynse), whose separate pronunciation and spelling reflect its reborrowing in Middle English from Anglo-Norman unce and ounce.In many other European languages, the word for \"inch\" is the same as or derived from the word for \"thumb\", as a man's thumb is about an inch wide (and this was even sometimes used to define the inch). Examples include Catalan: polzada (\"inch\") and polze (\"thumb\"); Czech: palec (\"thumb\"); Danish and Norwegian: tomme (\"inch\") tommel (\"thumb\"); Dutch: duim (whence Afrikaans: duim and Russian: \u0434\u044e\u0439\u043c); French: pouce; Hungarian: h\u00fcvelyk; Italian: pollice; Portuguese: polegada (\"inch\") and polegar (\"thumb\"); (\"duim\"); Slovak: palec (\"thumb\"); Spanish: pulgada (\"inch\") and pulgar (\"thumb\"); and Swedish: tum (\"inch\") and tumme (\"thumb\").\n\n\n== Usage ==\nThe inch is a commonly used customary unit of length in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It is also used in Japan for electronic parts, especially display screens. In most of continental Europe, the inch is also used informally as a measure for display screens. For the United Kingdom, guidance on public sector use states that, since 1 October 1995, without time limit, the inch (along with the foot) is to be used as a primary unit for road signs and related measurements of distance (with the possible exception of clearance heights and widths) and may continue to be used as a secondary or supplementary indication following a metric measurement for other purposes.Inches are commonly used to specify the diameter of vehicle wheel rims, and the corresponding inner diameter of tyres \u2013 the last number in a Car/Truck tire size such as 235/75 R16; the first two numbers give the width (normally expressed in millimetres for cars and light trucks) and aspect ratio of the tyre (height 75% of width in this example), the R Designates a Radial Ply Construction. Wheel manufacturers commonly specify the wheel width in inches (typically 6.5, 7, 7.5, or 8 for 235/75 tire).The international standard symbol for inch is in (see ISO 31-1, Annex A) but traditionally the inch is denoted by a double prime, which is often approximated by double quotes, and the foot by a prime, which is often approximated by an apostrophe. For example; three feet, two inches can be written as 3\u2032 2\u2033. (This is akin to how the first and second \"cuts\" of the hour are likewise indicated by prime and double prime symbols, and also the first and second cuts of the degree.)\nSubdivisions of an inch are typically written using dyadic fractions with odd number numerators; for example, two and three-eighths of an inch would be written as 2+3/8\u2033 and not as 2.375\u2033 nor as 2+6/16\u2033.  However, for engineering purposes fractions are commonly given to three or four places of decimals and have been for many years.\n\n\n=== Equivalents ===\n1 international inch is equal to:\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest known reference to the inch in England is from the Laws of \u00c6thelberht dating to the early 7th century, surviving in a single manuscript, the Textus Roffensis from 1120. Paragraph LXVII sets out the fine for wounds of various depths: one inch, one shilling; two inches, two shillings, etc.An Anglo-Saxon unit of length was the barleycorn. After 1066, 1 inch was equal to 3 barleycorns, which continued to be its legal definition for several centuries, with the barleycorn being the base unit. One of the earliest such definitions is that of 1324, where the legal definition of the inch was set out in a statute of Edward II of England, defining it as \"three grains of barley, dry and round, placed end to end, lengthwise\".Similar definitions are recorded in both English and Welsh medieval law tracts. One, dating from the first half of the 10th century, is contained in the Laws of Hywel Dda which superseded those of Dyfnwal, an even earlier definition of the inch in Wales. Both definitions, as recorded in Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales (vol i., pp. 184, 187, 189), are that \"three lengths of a barleycorn is the inch\".King David I of Scotland in his Assize of Weights and Measures (c. 1150) is said to have defined the Scottish inch as the width of an average man's thumb at the base of the nail, even including the requirement to calculate the average of a small, a medium, and a large man's measures. However, the oldest surviving manuscripts date from the early 14th century and appear to have been altered with the inclusion of newer material.In 1814, Charles Butler, a mathematics teacher at Cheam School, recorded the old legal definition of the inch to be \"three grains of sound ripe barley being taken out the middle of the ear, well dried, and laid end to end in a row\", and placed the barleycorn, not the inch, as the base unit of the English Long Measure system, from which all other units were derived. John Bouvier similarly recorded in his 1843 law dictionary that the barleycorn was the fundamental measure. Butler observed, however, that \"[a]s the length of the barley-corn cannot be fixed, so the inch according to this method will be uncertain\", noting that a standard inch measure was now [i.e. by 1843] kept in the Exchequer chamber, Guildhall, and that was the legal definition of the inch.This was a point also made by George Long in his 1842 Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia, observing that standard measures had since surpassed the barleycorn definition of the inch, and that to recover the inch measure from its original definition, in the event that the standard measure were destroyed, would involve the measurement of large numbers of barleycorns and taking their average lengths. He noted that this process would not perfectly recover the standard, since it might introduce errors of anywhere between one hundredth and one tenth of an inch in the definition of a yard.Before the adoption of the international yard and pound, various definitions were in use. In the United Kingdom and most countries of the British Commonwealth, the inch was defined in terms of the Imperial Standard Yard. The United States adopted the conversion factor 1 metre = 39.37 inches by an act in 1866. In 1893, Mendenhall ordered the physical realization of the inch to be based on the international prototype metres numbers 21 and 27, which had been received from the CGPM, together with the previously adopted conversion factor.As a result of the definitions above, the U.S. inch was effectively defined as 25.4000508 mm (with a reference temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit) and the UK inch at 25.399977 mm (with a reference temperature of 62 degrees Fahrenheit). When Carl Edvard Johansson started manufacturing gauge blocks in inch sizes in 1912, Johansson's compromise was to manufacture gauge blocks with a nominal size of 25.4mm, with a reference temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, accurate to within a few parts per million of both official definitions. Because Johansson's blocks were so popular, his blocks became the de facto standard for manufacturers internationally, with other manufacturers of gauge blocks following Johansson's definition by producing blocks designed to be equivalent to his.In 1930, the British Standards Institution adopted an inch of exactly 25.4 mm. The American Standards Association followed suit in 1933. By 1935, industry in 16 countries had adopted the \"industrial inch\" as it came to be known, effectively endorsing Johansson's pragmatic choice of conversion ratio.In 1946, the Commonwealth Science Congress recommended a yard of exactly 0.9144 metres for adoption throughout the British Commonwealth. This was adopted by Canada in 1951; the United States on 1 July 1959; Australia in 1961, effective 1 January 1964; and the United Kingdom in 1963, effective on 1 January 1964. The new standards gave an inch of exactly 25.4 mm, 1.7 millionths of an inch longer than the old imperial inch and 2 millionths of an inch shorter than the old US inch.\n\n\n== Related units ==\n\n\n=== US Survey inches ===\nThe United States retains the 1/39.37-metre definition for survey purposes, producing a 2 millionth part difference between standard and US survey inches. This is approximately 1/8 inch per mile. In fact, 12.7 kilometres is exactly 500,000 standard inches and exactly 499,999 survey inches. This difference is substantial when doing calculations in State Plane Coordinate Systems with coordinate values in the hundreds of thousands or millions of feet.\nIn 2020, the U.S. NIST announced that the U.S. survey foot would \"be phased out\" on 1 January 2023 and be superseded by the International foot (also known as the foot) equal to 0.3048 meters exactly, for all further applications. and by implication, the survey inch with it.\n\n\n=== Continental inches ===\n\nBefore the adoption of the metric system, several European countries had customary units whose name translates into \"inch\". The French pouce measured roughly 27.0 mm, at least when applied to describe the calibre of artillery pieces. The Amsterdam foot (voet) consisted of 11 Amsterdam inches (duim). The Amsterdam foot is about 8% shorter than an English foot.\n\n\n=== Scottish inch ===\nThe now obsolete Scottish inch (Scottish Gaelic: \u00f2irleach), 1/12 of a Scottish foot, was about 1.0016 imperial inches (about 25.4406 mm).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAttenborough, F.

        "text": "The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate. For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, syrup has a higher viscosity than water.Viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal frictional force that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a viscous fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some stress (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube. This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion. So for a tube with a constant rate of flow, the strength of the compensating force is proportional to the fluid's viscosity. \nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids. Otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity; such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as pitch, may appear to be a solid.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the Latin viscum (\"mistletoe\"). Viscum also referred to a viscous glue derived from mistletoe berries.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n\nIn materials science and engineering, one is often interested in understanding the forces or stresses involved in the deformation of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by Hooke's law, which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called elastic stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the rate of change of the deformation over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the distance the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how quickly the shearing occurs.\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar Couette flow.\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n   at the bottom to \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   at the top. Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a force resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   at the top. Moreover, the magnitude \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F}\n   of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   and the area \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  : \n\n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        A\n        \n          \n            u\n            y\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F=\\mu A{\\frac {u}{y}}.}\n  The proportionality factor \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, with units of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Pa\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          s\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Pa}}\\cdot {\\text{s}}}\n   (pascal-second), often simply referred to as the viscosity. \nThe ratio \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        \n          /\n        \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u/y}\n   is called the rate of shear deformation or shear velocity, and is the derivative of the fluid speed in the direction perpendicular to the plates (see illustrations to the right).

It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.\nUse of the Greek letter mu (\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  ) for the dynamic viscosity (sometimes also called the absolute viscosity) is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as mathematicians and physicists. However, the Greek letter eta (\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b7\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta }\n  ) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the IUPAC. The viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   is sometimes also called the shear viscosity.

As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity. (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n          \n            i\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            \u2113\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            i\n            j\n            k\n            \u2113\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              \n                v\n                \n                  k\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              \n                r\n                \n                  \u2113\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau _{ij}=\\sum _{k}\\sum _{\\ell }\\mu _{ijk\\ell }{\\frac {\\partial v_{k}}{\\partial r_{\\ell }}},}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            i\n            j\n            k\n            \u2113\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{ijk\\ell }}\n   is a viscosity tensor that maps the velocity gradient tensor \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2202\n        \n          v\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        \u2202\n        \n          r\n          \n            \u2113\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\partial v_{k}/\\partial r_{\\ell }}\n   onto the viscous stress tensor \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n          \n            i\n            j\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau _{ij}}\n  .

For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2207\n        \u22c5\n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} =0}\n   and so the term containing \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03ba\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n   drops out. Moreover, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03ba\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n   is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n   in a monatomic ideal gas. One situation in which \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03ba\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n   can be important is the calculation of energy loss in sound and shock waves, described by Stokes' law of sound attenuation, since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n\n=== Kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is sometimes more convenient to work in terms of the kinematic viscosity (sometimes also called the momentum diffusivity), defined as the ratio of the viscosity \u03bc to the density of the fluid \u03c1. It is usually denoted by the Greek letter nu (\u03bd) and has dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          l\n          e\n          n\n          g\n          t\n          h\n          \n            )\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          \n            /\n          \n          t\n          i\n          m\n          e\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {(length)^{2}/time} }\n  :\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bd\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03bc\n            \u03c1\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu ={\\frac {\\mu }{\\rho }},}\n  in order to distinguish it from the dynamic viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  , which has dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          o\n          r\n          c\n          e\n          \u00d7\n          t\n          i\n          m\n          e\n          \n            /\n          \n          a\n          r\n          e\n          a\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {force\\times time/area} }\n  .\n\n\n== Momentum transport ==\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conductivity characterizes heat transport, and (mass) diffusivity characterizes mass transport. To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        (\n        \u2202\n        u\n        \n          /\n        \n        \u2202\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =\\mu (\\partial u/\\partial y)}\n  , the shear stress \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau }\n   has units equivalent to a momentum flux, i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau }\n   can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n   direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called constitutive relations, whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  J\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \u2212\n                D\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      \u03c1\n                    \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  (Fick's law of diffusion)\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  q\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \u2212\n                \n                  k\n                  \n                    t\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      T\n                    \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      x\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  (Fourier's law of heat conduction)\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \u03c4\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \u03bc\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      u\n                    \n                    \n                      \u2202\n                      y\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  (Newton's law of viscosity)\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf {J} &=-D{\\frac {\\partial \\rho }{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)}}\\\\[5pt]\\mathbf {q} &=-k_{t}{\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)}}\\\\[5pt]\\tau &=\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\partial y}}&&{\\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}}\\end{aligned}}}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho }\n   is the density, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          J\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {J} }\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          q\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {q} }\n   are the mass and heat fluxes, and \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{t}}\n   are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity. The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n\n== Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids ==\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a constitutive equation (like Hooke's law, Fick's law, and Ohm's law) which serves to define the viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  . Its form is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called Newtonian. Gases, water, and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many non-Newtonian fluids that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\nShear-thickening liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\nShear-thinning liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\nThixotropic liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\nRheopectic (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\nBingham plastics that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.Trouton's ratio is the ratio of extensional viscosity to shear viscosity. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3. Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.Even for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other compressible fluids, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A magnetorheological fluid, for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a magnetic field, possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n\n== In solids ==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the elastic forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the rate of deformation over time. For this reason, Maxwell used the term fugitive elasticity for fluid viscosity.\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even granite) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress. Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being viscoelastic.\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The extensional viscosity is a linear combination of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\nIn geology, earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three orders of magnitude greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called rheids.\n\n\n== Measurement ==\n\nViscosity is measured with various types of viscometers and rheometers. A rheometer is used for fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to obtain accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5 \u00b0C.For some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates (Newtonian fluids). The fluids without a constant viscosity (non-Newtonian fluids) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\nIn coating industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the efflux time is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the Zahn cup and the Ford viscosity cup \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.Extensional viscosity can be measured with various rheometers that apply extensional stress.\nVolume viscosity can be measured with an acoustic rheometer.\nApparent viscosity is a calculation derived from tests performed on drilling fluid used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\nNanoviscosity (viscosity sensed by nanoprobes) can be measured by Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.\n\n\n== Units ==\nThe SI unit of dynamic viscosity is the newton-second per square meter (N\u00b7s/m2), also frequently expressed in the equivalent forms pascal-second (Pa\u00b7s) and kilogram per meter per second (kg\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7s\u22121). The CGS unit is the poise (P, or g\u00b7cm\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s), named after Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille. It is commonly expressed, particularly in ASTM standards, as centipoise (cP), because it is more convenient (for instance the viscosity of water at 20 \u00b0C is about 1 cP), and one centipoise is equal to the SI millipascal second (mPa\u00b7s).\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m2/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the stokes (St, or cm2\u00b7s\u22121 = 0.0001 m2\u00b7s\u22121), named after Sir George Gabriel Stokes. In U.S. usage, stoke is sometimes used as the singular form. The submultiple centistokes (cSt) is often used instead, 1 cSt = 1 mm2\u00b7s\u22121 = 10\u22126 m2\u00b7s\u22121. The kinematic viscosity of water at 20 \u00b0C is about 1 cSt.\nThe most frequently used systems of US customary, or Imperial, units are the British Gravitational (BG) and English Engineering (EE). In the BG system, dynamic viscosity has units of pound-seconds per square foot (lb\u00b7s/ft2), and in the EE system it has units of pound-force-seconds per square foot (lbf\u00b7s/ft2). Note that the pound and pound-force are equivalent; the two systems differ only in how force and mass are defined. In the BG system the pound is a basic unit from which the unit of mass (the slug) is defined by Newton's Second Law, whereas in the EE system the units of force and mass (the pound-force and pound-mass respectively) are defined independently through the Second Law using the proportionality constant gc.\nKinematic viscosity has units of square feet per second (ft2/s) in both the BG and EE systems.\nNonstandard units include the reyn, a British unit of dynamic viscosity. In the automotive industry the viscosity index is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\nThe reciprocal of viscosity is fluidity, usually symbolized by \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n        =\n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi =1/\\mu }\n   or \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F=1/\\mu }\n  , depending on the convention used, measured in reciprocal poise (P\u22121, or cm\u00b7s\u00b7g\u22121), sometimes called the rhe. Fluidity is seldom used in engineering practice.\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the Saybolt viscometer, and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of Saybolt universal seconds (SUS). Other abbreviations such as SSU (Saybolt seconds universal) or SUV (Saybolt universal viscosity) are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161.\n\n\n== Molecular origins ==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the Green\u2013Kubo relations for the linear shear viscosity or the transient time correlation function expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988. Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of molecular dynamics computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the equations of motion of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is Chapman\u2013Enskog theory, which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the Boltzmann equation.Momentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together. Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n\n=== Pure gases ===\n\nViscosity in gases arises principally from the molecular diffusion that transports momentum between layers of flow.

In particular, since \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bb\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   is typically inversely proportional to density and increases with temperature, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   itself should increase with temperature and be independent of density at fixed temperature. In fact, both of these predictions persist in more sophisticated treatments, and accurately describe experimental observations. Note that this behavior runs counter to common intuition regarding liquids, for which viscosity typically decreases with temperature.For rigid elastic spheres of diameter \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bb\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   can be computed, giving\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            \n              \u03c0\n              \n                3\n                \n                  /\n                \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                k\n                \n                  B\n                \n              \n              m\n              T\n            \n            \n              \u03c3\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu ={\\frac {\\alpha }{\\pi ^{3/2}}}{\\frac {\\sqrt {k_{\\text{B}}mT}}{\\sigma ^{2}}}.}\n  In this case \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bb\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n   is independent of temperature, so \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        \u221d\n        \n          T\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu \\propto T^{1/2}}\n  .

More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.\n\n\n==== Chapman\u2013Enskog theory ====\n\nA technique developed by Sydney Chapman and David Enskog in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  . It is based on the Boltzmann equation, which provides a systematic statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular interactions. As such, their technique allows accurate calculation of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   for more realistic molecular models, such as those incorporating intermolecular attraction rather than just hard-core repulsion.\nIt turns out that a more realistic modeling of interactions is essential for accurate prediction of the temperature dependence of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  , which experiments show increases more rapidly than the \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T^{1/2}}\n   trend predicted for rigid elastic spheres. Indeed, the Chapman\u2013Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model, which describes rigid elastic spheres with weak mutual attraction. In such a case, the attractive force can be treated perturbatively, which leads to a particularly simple expression for \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  :\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        =\n        \n          \n            5\n            \n              16\n              \n                \u03c3\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    k\n                    \n                      B\n                    \n                  \n                  m\n                  T\n                \n                \u03c0\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                \n                  S\n                  T\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu ={\\frac {5}{16\\sigma ^{2}}}\\left({\\frac {k_{\\text{B}}mT}{\\pi }}\\right)^{1/2}\\left(1+{\\frac {S}{T}}\\right)^{-1},}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n   is independent of temperature, being determined only by the parameters of the intermolecular attraction.

If \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   is known from experiments at \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        =\n        \n          T\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T=T_{0}}\n   and at least one other temperature, then \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n   can be calculated. It turns out that expressions for \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   obtained in this way are accurate for a number of gases over a sizable range of temperatures. On the other hand, Chapman & Cowling 1970 argue that this success does not imply that molecules actually interact according to the Sutherland model. Rather, they interpret the prediction for \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the Lennard-Jones potential, may provide a better picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature. In some systems the assumption of spherical symmetry must be abandoned as well, as is the case for vapors with highly polar molecules like H2O.\n\n\n==== Bulk viscosity ====\nIn the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their internal energy, e.g. rotational and vibrational. As such, the bulk viscosity is \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n   for a monatomic ideal gas, in which the internal energy of molecules in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide, whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational energy.\n\n\n=== Pure liquids ===\n\nIn contrast with gases, there is no simple yet accurate picture for the molecular origins of viscosity in liquids.\nAt the simplest level of description, the relative motion of adjacent layers in a liquid is opposed primarily by attractive molecular forces\nacting across the layer boundary. In this picture, one (correctly) expects viscosity to decrease with increasing temperature. This is because\nincreasing temperature increases the random thermal motion of the molecules, which makes it easier for them to overcome their attractive interactions.Building on this visualization, a simple theory can be constructed in analogy with the discrete structure of a solid: groups of molecules in a liquid \nare visualized as forming \"cages\" which surround and enclose single molecules. These cages can be occupied or unoccupied, and\nstronger molecular attraction corresponds to stronger cages.\nDue to random thermal motion, a molecule \"hops\" between cages at a rate which varies inversely with the strength of molecular attractions. In equilibrium these \"hops\" are not biased in any direction.\nOn the other hand, in order for two adjacent layers to move relative to each other, the \"hops\" must be biased in the direction\nof the relative motion. The force required to sustain this directed motion can be estimated for a given shear rate, leading to\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          N\n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N_{A}}\n   is the Avogadro constant, \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   is the Planck constant, \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n   is the volume of a mole of liquid, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{b}}\n   is the normal boiling point. This result has the same form as the widespread and accurate empirical relation\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n   are constants fit from data. On the other hand, several authors express caution with respect to this model.\nErrors as large as 30% can be encountered using equation (1), compared with fitting equation (2) to experimental data. More fundamentally, the physical assumptions underlying equation (1) have been criticized. It has also been argued that the exponential dependence in equation (1) does not necessarily describe experimental observations more accurately than simpler, non-exponential expressions.In light of these shortcomings, the development of a less ad hoc model is a matter of practical interest.\nForegoing simplicity in favor of precision, it is possible to write rigorous expressions for viscosity starting from the fundamental equations of motion for molecules. A classic example \nof this approach is Irving\u2013Kirkwood theory. On the other hand, such expressions\nare given as averages over multiparticle correlation functions and are therefore difficult to apply in practice.\nIn general, empirically derived expressions (based on existing viscosity measurements) appear to be the only consistently reliable means of calculating viscosity in liquids.\n\n\n=== Mixtures and blends ===\n\n\n==== Gaseous mixtures ====\nThe same molecular-kinetic picture of a single component gas can also be applied to a gaseous mixture. For instance, in the Chapman\u2013Enskog approach the viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            mix\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{mix}}}\n   of a binary mixture of gases can be written in terms of the individual component viscosities \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            1\n            ,\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{1,2}}\n  , their respective volume fractions, and the intermolecular interactions. As for the single-component gas, the dependence of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            mix\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{mix}}}\n   on the parameters of the intermolecular interactions enters through various collisional integrals which may not be expressible in terms of elementary functions. To obtain usable expressions for \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            mix\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{mix}}}\n   which reasonably match experimental data, the collisional integrals typically must be evaluated using some combination of analytic calculation and empirical fitting. An example of such a procedure is the Sutherland approach for the single-component gas, discussed above.\n\n\n==== Blends of liquids ====\nAs for pure liquids, the viscosity of a blend of liquids is difficult to predict from molecular principles. One method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theory presented above for a pure liquid. This can be done with varying levels of sophistication.

Such suspensions generally exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. However, for dilute systems in steady flows, the behavior is Newtonian and expressions for \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            eff\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{eff}}}\n   can be derived directly from the particle dynamics. In a very dilute system, with volume fraction \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n        \u2272\n        0.02\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi \\lesssim 0.02}\n  , interactions between the suspended particles can be ignored. In such a case one can explicitly calculate the flow field around each particle independently, and combine the results to obtain \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            eff\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\text{eff}}}\n  .

In contrast to the viscosity of the fluid itself, which must be positive by the second law of thermodynamics, the eddy viscosity can be negative.\n\n\n== Selected substances ==\n\nObserved values of viscosity vary over several orders of magnitude, even for common substances (see the order of magnitude table below). For instance, a 70% sucrose (sugar) solution has a viscosity over 400 times that of water, and 26000 times that of air. More dramatically, pitch has been estimated to have a viscosity 230 billion times that of water.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe dynamic viscosity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n   of water is about 0.89 mPa\u00b7s at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). As a function of temperature in kelvins, the viscosity can be estimated using the semi-empirical Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        =\n        A\n        exp\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              B\n              \n                T\n                \u2212\n                C\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu =A\\exp \\left({\\frac {B}{T-C}}\\right)}\n  where A = 0.02939 mPa\u00b7s, B = 507.88 K, and C = 149.3 K. Experimentally determined values of the viscosity are also given in the table below. Note that at 20 \u00b0C the dynamic viscosity is about 1 cP and the kinematic viscosity is about 1 cSt.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nUnder standard atmospheric conditions (25 \u00b0C and pressure of 1 bar), the dynamic viscosity of air is 18.5 \u03bcPa\u00b7s, roughly 50 times smaller than the viscosity of water at the same temperature. Except at very high pressure, the viscosity of air depends mostly on the temperature.

For this formula to be valid, the temperature must be given in kelvins; \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b7\n          \n            air\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta _{\\text{air}}}\n   then corresponds to the viscosity in Pa\u00b7s.\n\n\n=== Other common substances ===\n\n\n=== Order of magnitude estimates ===\nThe following table illustrates the range of viscosity values observed in common substances. Unless otherwise noted, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C and a pressure of 1 atmosphere are assumed. Certain substances of variable composition or with non-Newtonian behavior are not assigned precise values, since in these cases viscosity depends on additional factors besides temperature and pressure.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nFluid properties \u2013 high accuracy calculation of viscosity for frequently encountered pure liquids and gases\nGas viscosity calculator as function of temperature\nAir viscosity calculator as function of temperature and pressure\nFluid Characteristics Chart \u2013 a table of viscosities and vapor pressures for various fluids\nGas Dynamics Toolbox \u2013 calculate coefficient of viscosity for mixtures of gases\nGlass Viscosity Measurement \u2013 viscosity measurement, viscosity units and fixpoints, glass viscosity calculation\nKinematic Viscosity \u2013 conversion between kinematic and dynamic viscosity\nPhysical Characteristics of Water \u2013 a table of water viscosity as a function of temperature\nVogel\u2013Tammann\u2013Fulcher Equation Parameters\nCalculation of temperature-dependent dynamic viscosities for some common components\n\"Test Procedures for Testing Highway and Nonroad Engines and Omnibus Technical Amendments\" \u2013 United States Environmental Protection Agency\nArtificial viscosity\nViscosity of Air, Dynamic and Kinematic, Engineers Edge",

        "text": "In chemistry, the amount of substance in a given sample of matter is defined as the number of discrete atomic-scale particles in it divided by the Avogadro constant NA. In a truly atomistic view, the amount of substance is simply the number of particles that constitute the substance. The particles or entities may be molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, or other, depending on the context. The value of the Avogadro constant NA has been defined as 6.02214076\u00d71023 mol\u22121. In the truly atomistic view, 1 mol = 6.02214076\u00d71023 particles (the Avogadro number)  and therefore the conversion constant is simply NA = 1. The amount of substance is sometimes referred to as the chemical amount.\nThe mole (symbol: mol) is a unit of amount of substance in the International System of Units, defined (since 2019) by fixing the Avogadro constant at the given value.  Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a chemical compound, in grams, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in daltons, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015  daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains 6.02214076\u00d71023 water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\nIn chemistry, because of the law of multiple proportions, it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of oxygen (O2) will react with 2 molecules of hydrogen (H2) to make 2 molecules of water (H2O)\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of O2 will react with 2 moles of H2 to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g  (1 mole) of oxygen  will react with approximately 4.0304 g (2 moles of H2) hydrogen to make approximately 36.0304 g (2 moles) of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the isotopic composition of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in thermodynamics.  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a noble gas in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the ideal gas law), not to its mass.\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the English language. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume, rather than the number of particles. There are proposals to replace \"amount of substance\" with more easily-distinguishable terms, such as enplethy  and stoichiometric amount.The IUPAC recommends that \"amount of substance\" should be used instead of \"number of moles\", just as the quantity mass should not be called \"number of kilograms\".\n\n\n== Nature of the particles ==\nTo avoid ambiguity, the nature of the particles should be specified in any measurement of the amount of substance: thus, 1 mol of molecules of oxygen (O2) is about 32 grams, whereas 1 mol of atoms of oxygen (O) is about 16 grams.\n\n\n== Derived quantities ==\n\n\n=== Molar quantities (per mole) ===\nThe quotient of some extensive physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an intensive property of the substance, usually named by the prefix molar.For example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the molar mass, whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for iron.  From the volume, one gets the molar volume, which is about 17.962 milliliter/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the heat capacity, one gets the molar heat capacity, which is about 75.385 J/K/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n\n=== Amount concentration (moles per liter) ===\nAnother important derived quantity is the amount of substance concentration (also called amount concentration, or substance concentration in clinical chemistry; which is defined as the amount of a specific substance in a sample of a solution (or some other mixture), divided by the volume of the sample.\nThe SI unit of this quantity is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution).  Thus, for example, the amount concentration of sodium chloride in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard vodka contains about 0.40 L of ethanol (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L.\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as molar, and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of urea (CH4N2O) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the molarity of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.This quantity should not be confused with the mass concentration, which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water).\n\n\n=== Amount fraction (moles per mole) ===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the amount fraction.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe alchemists, and especially the early metallurgists, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, Mikhail Lomonosov questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter, but he did so only in relation to his theories on gravitation. The development of the concept of amount of substance was coincidental with, and vital to, the birth of modern chemistry.\n\n1777: Wenzel publishes Lessons on Affinity, in which he demonstrates that the proportions of the \"base component\" and the \"acid component\" (cation and anion in modern terminology) remain the same during reactions between two neutral salts.\n1789: Lavoisier publishes Treatise of Elementary Chemistry, introducing the concept of a chemical element and clarifying the Law of conservation of mass for chemical reactions.\n1792: Richter publishes the first volume of Stoichiometry or the Art of Measuring the Chemical Elements (publication of subsequent volumes continues until 1802). The term \"stoichiometry\" is used for the first time. The first tables of equivalent weights are published for acid\u2013base reactions. Richter also notes that, for a given acid, the equivalent mass of the acid is proportional to the mass of oxygen in the base.\n1794: Proust's Law of definite proportions generalizes the concept of equivalent weights to all types of chemical reaction, not simply acid\u2013base reactions.\n1805: Dalton publishes his first paper on modern atomic theory, including a \"Table of the relative weights of the ultimate particles of gaseous and other bodies\".The concept of atoms raised the question of their weight. While many were skeptical about the reality of atoms, chemists quickly found atomic weights to be an invaluable tool in expressing stoichiometric relationships.\n1808: Publication of Dalton's A New System of Chemical Philosophy, containing the first table of atomic weights (based on H = 1).\n1809: Gay-Lussac's Law of combining volumes, stating an integer relationship between the volumes of reactants and products in the chemical reactions of gases.\n1811: Avogadro hypothesizes that equal volumes of different gases (at same temperature and pressure) contain equal numbers of particles, now known as Avogadro's law.\n1813/1814: Berzelius publishes the first of several tables of atomic weights based on the scale of O = 100.\n1815: Prout publishes his hypothesis that all atomic weights are integer multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. The hypothesis is later abandoned given the observed atomic weight of chlorine (approx. 35.5 relative to hydrogen).\n1819: Dulong\u2013Petit law relating the atomic weight of a solid element to its specific heat capacity.\n1819: Mitscherlich's work on crystal isomorphism allows many chemical formulae to be clarified, resolving several ambiguities in the calculation of atomic weights.\n1834: Clapeyron states the ideal gas law.The ideal gas law was the first to be discovered of many relationships between the number of atoms or molecules in a system and other physical properties of the system, apart from its mass. However, this was not sufficient to convince all scientists of the existence of atoms and molecules, many considered it simply being a useful tool for calculation.\n1834: Faraday states his Laws of electrolysis, in particular that \"the chemical decomposing action of a current is constant for a constant quantity of electricity\".\n1856: Kr\u00f6nig derives the ideal gas law from kinetic theory. Clausius publishes an independent derivation the following year.\n1860: The Karlsruhe Congress debates the relation between \"physical molecules\", \"chemical molecules\" and atoms, without reaching consensus.\n1865: Loschmidt makes the first estimate of the size of gas molecules and hence of number of molecules in a given volume of gas, now known as the Loschmidt constant.\n1886: van't Hoff demonstrates the similarities in behaviour between dilute solutions and ideal gases.\n1886: Eugen Goldstein observes discrete particle rays in gas discharges, laying the foundation of mass spectrometry, a tool subsequently used to establish the masses of atoms and molecules.\n1887: Arrhenius describes the dissociation of electrolyte in solution, resolving one of the problems in the study of colligative properties.\n1893: First recorded use of the term mole to describe a unit of amount of substance by Ostwald in a university textbook.\n1897: First recorded use of the term mole in English.\nBy the turn of the twentieth century, the concept of atomic and molecular entities was generally accepted, but many questions remained, not least the size of atoms and their number in a given sample. The concurrent development of mass spectrometry, starting in 1886, supported the concept of atomic and molecular mass and provided a tool of direct relative measurement.\n1905: Einstein's paper on Brownian motion dispels any last doubts on the physical reality of atoms, and opens the way for an accurate determination of their mass.\n1909: Perrin coins the name Avogadro constant and estimates its value.\n1913: Discovery of isotopes of non-radioactive elements by Soddy and Thomson.\n1914: Richards receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for \"his determinations of the atomic weight of a large number of elements\".\n1920: Aston proposes the whole number rule, an updated version of Prout's hypothesis.\n1921: Soddy receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his work on the chemistry of radioactive substances and investigations into isotopes\".\n1922: Aston receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his whole-number rule\".\n1926: Perrin receives the Nobel Prize in Physics, in part for his work in measuring the Avogadro constant.\n1959/1960: Unified atomic mass unit scale based on 12C = 12 adopted by IUPAP and IUPAC.\n1968: The mole is recommended for inclusion in the International System of Units (SI) by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM).\n1972: The mole is approved as the SI base unit of amount of substance.\n2019: The mole is redefined in the SI as \"the amount of substance of a system that contains 6.02214076\u00d71023 specified elementary entities\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmount fraction\nInternational System of Quantities\n\n\n== References ==",
