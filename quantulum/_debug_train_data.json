when the gold nobl was success introduc into circulation. however, silver remain the legal basi for the pound sterl until dure the time of henri iii, the pound sterl equal the tower (weight) pound. in the year of edward i (around the tale (money) pound, or pound sterling, first began to differ from (weigh less than) the tower pound, from which it originated, for by indentur of that year the pound weight was to contain in tale pound. in the year of edward iii (around the pound sterl was now onli of the pound weight, or oz dwt (or oz) tower. by an act of the year of henri iv reign (around the pound weight of standard silver was to contain thirti shill in tale, or one and a half pound sterling; thus the pound sterl reduc to two-third of a pound weight, or oz tower. the pound sterl was adjust in weight sever more time subsequently. in the reign of henri iv the penni was reduc in weight to grain g) of silver, with a further reduct to grain g) in === tudor === dure the reign of henri viii and edward vi, the silver coinag was drastic debased, although the pound was redefin to the troy pound of grain g) in in a silver coinag was issu contain just one-third silver and two-third copper\u2014equ to silver, or pure. the result was a coin copper in appear but relat pale in colour. in a new silver coinag was introduced, struck in sterl silver. however, the penni weight was reduc to grain g), so troy pound of sterl silver produc shill of coins. this silver standard was known as the standard\" and last until when a standard\" was introduced, reduc the penni weight to grain g).throughout this period, the size and valu of the gold coinag fluctuat considerably. === unoffici gold standard === in a new gold coinag was introduced, base on the carat fine guinea. fix in weight at to the troy pound in this coin valu vari consider against the silver coinag until when it was fix at shill pounds). however, despit the effort of sir isaac newton, master of the mint, to reduc the guinea value, this valuat remain fixed, overvalu gold relat to silver, when compar to the valuat in other european countries. in line with gresham law, english merchant sent silver abroad in payments, while good for export were paid for with gold. scotland, meanwhile, had it own pound scots. as a consequ of these flow of silver out and gold in, england was effect on a gold standard. trade with china aggrav this outflow, as the chines refus to accept anyth but silver in payment for exports. from the century, around metric ton long tons) of silver were receiv by china, princip from european powers, in exchang for chines tea and other goods. in order to trade with china, england had first to trade with the other european nation to receiv silver, which led to the east india compani redress this trade imbal through the indirect sale of opium to the chinese.domest demand for silver further reduc silver in circulation, as the improv fortun of the merchant class led to increas demand for tableware. silversmith had alway regard coinag as a sourc of raw material, alreadi verifi for fine by the government. as a result, sterl coin were be melt and fashion into sterl silverwar at an acceler rate. an act of the parliament of england in tri to stem this tide by rais the minimum accept fine on wrought plate from sterl to a new britannia silver standard of silverwar made pure from melt coin would be found want when the silversmith took his ware to the assay office, thus discourag the melt of coins. === establish of modern currenc === the bank of england was found in follow by

their exist (e.g. the south african pound), while other deviat from pariti after the end of the gold standard (e.g. the australian pound). these currenc and other tie to sterl constitut the sterl area. the origin english coloni on mainland north america were not parti to the sterl area becaus the above-ment silver shortag in england coincid with these coloni format years. as a result of equit trade (and rather less equit piracy), the spanish mill dollar becam the most common coin within the english colonies. === gold standard === dure the american war of independ and the napoleon wars,

the hous of common in june by william brown, mp for lancashir southern, with the suggest that the pound sterl be divid into one thousand parts, each call a \"mil\", or altern a farthing, as the pound was then equival to farth which could easili be round up to one thousand farth in the new system. this did not result in the convers of the pound sterl into a decim system, but it was agre to establish a royal commiss to look into the issue. however, larg due to the hostil to decimalis of two of the appoint commissioners, lord overston (a banker) and john hubbard (governor of the bank of england), decimalis in britain was effect quash for over a hundr years.however, the pound sterl was decimalis in various british coloni territori befor the unit kingdom (and in sever case in line with

    "the second symbol s abbrevi sec is the base unit of time in the intern system of unit si french syst\u00e8m intern d unit\u00e9 common understood and histor defin as of a day this factor deriv from the divis of the day first into hour then to minut and final to second each analog clock and watch often have sixti tick mark on their face repres second and minut and a second hand to mark the passag of time in second digit clock and watch often have a two digit second counter the second is also part of sever other unit of measur like meter per second for speed meter per second per second for acceler and cycl per second for frequenc although the histor definit of the unit was base on this divis of the earth s rotat cycl the formal definit in the intern system of unit si is a much steadier timekeeper:th second is defin as be equal to the time durat of period of the radiat correspond to the transit between the two hyperfin level of the fundament unperturb ground-stat of the atom. becaus the earth rotat vari and is also slow ever so slightly, a leap second is period ad to clock time to keep clock in sync with earth rotation. multipl of second are usual count in hour and minutes. fraction of a second are usual count in tenth or hundredths. in scientif work, small fraction of a second are count in millisecond (thousandths), microsecond (millionths), nanosecond (billionths), and sometim smaller unit of a second. an everyday experi with small fraction of a second is a microprocessor which has a cycl time of nanosecond. camera shutter speed are often express in fraction of a second, such as second or second. sexagesim divis of the day from a calendar base on astronom observ have exist sinc the third millennium bc, though they were not second as we know them today. small divis of time could not be measur back then, so such divis were mathemat derived. the first timekeep that could count second accur were pendulum clock invent in the century. start in the atom clock becam better timekeep than earth rotation, and they continu to set the standard today. == clock and solar time == a mechan clock, one which doe not depend on measur the relat rotat posit of the earth, keep uniform time call mean time, within whatev accuraci is intrins to it. that mean that everi second, minut and everi other divis of time count by the clock will be the same durat as ani other ident divis of time. but a sundial which measur the relat posit of the sun in the sky call appar time, doe not keep uniform time. the time kept by a sundial vari by time of year, mean that seconds, minut and everi other divis of time is a differ durat at differ time of the year. the time of day measur with mean time versus appar time may differ by as much as minutes, but a singl day will differ from the next by onli a small amount; minut is a cumul differ over a part of the year. the effect is due chiefli to the obliqu of earth axi with respect to it orbit around the sun. the differ between appar solar time and mean time was recogn by astronom sinc antiquity, but prior to the invent of accur mechan clock in the century, sundial were the onli reliabl timepieces, and appar solar time was the onli general accept standard. == event and unit of time in second == fraction of a second are usual denot in decim notation, for exampl seconds, or two and one hundredth seconds. multipl of second are usual express as minut and seconds, or hours, minut and second of clock time, separ by colons, such as or (the latter notat can give rise to ambiguity, becaus the same notat is use to denot hour and minutes). it rare make sens to express longer period of time like hour or day in seconds, becaus they are awkward larg numbers. for the metric unit of second, there are decim prefix repres to seconds. some common unit of time in second are: a minut is seconds; an hour is seconds; a day is seconds; a week is seconds; a year (other than leap years) is seconds; and a (gregorian) centuri averag seconds; with all of the abov exclud ani possibl leap seconds. some common event in second are: a stone fall about meter from rest in one second; a pendulum of length about one meter has a swing of one second, so pendulum clock have pendulum about a meter long; the fastest human sprinter run meter in a second; an ocean wave in deep water travel about meter in one second; sound travel about meter in one second in air; light take second to reach earth from the surfac of the moon, a distanc of kilometers. == other unit incorpor second == a second is part of other units, such as frequenc measur in hertz (invers second or speed (meter per second) and acceler (meter per second squared). the metric system unit becquerel, a measur of radioact decay, is measur in invers seconds. the meter is defin in term of the speed of light and the second; definit of the metric base unit kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and candela also depend on the second. the onli base unit whose definit doe not depend on the second is the mole. of the name deriv unit of the si, onli two (radian and steradian), do not depend on the second. mani deriv unit for everyday thing are report in term of larger unit of time, not seconds, such as clock time in hour and minutes, veloc of a car in kilomet per hour or mile per hour, kilowatt hour of electr usage, and speed of a turntabl in rotat per minute. == timekeep standard == a set of atom clock throughout the world keep time by consensus: the clock \"vote\" on the correct time, and all vote clock are steer to agre with the consensus, which is call intern atom time (tai). tai \"ticks\" atom seconds.civil time is defin to agre with the rotat of the earth. the intern standard for timekeep is coordin univers time (utc). this time scale \"ticks\" the same atom second as tai, but insert or omit leap second as necessari to correct for variat in the rate of rotat of the earth.a time scale in which the second are not exact equal to atom second is a form of univers time. is defin by the rotat of the earth with respect to the sun, and doe not contain ani leap seconds. alway differ from utc by less than a second. == optic lattic clock == while they are not yet part of ani timekeep standard, optic lattic clock with frequenc in the visibl light spectrum now exist and are the most accur timekeep of all. a strontium clock with frequenc thz, in the red rang of visibl light, now hold the accuraci record: it will gain or lose less than a second in billion years, which is longer than the estim age of the universe. such a clock can measur a chang in it elev of as littl as cm by the chang in it rate due to gravit time dilation. == histori of definit == there have onli ever been three definit of the second: as a fraction of the day, as a fraction of an extrapol year, and as the microwav frequenc of a caesium atom clock, and they have realiz a sexagesim divis of the day from ancient astronom calendars. === sexagesim divis of calendar time and day === civil in the classic period and earlier creat divis of the calendar as well as arc use a sexagesim system of counting, so at that time the second was a sexagesim subdivis of the day (ancient second = not of the hour like the modern second (= sundial and water clock were among the earliest timekeep devices, and unit of time were measur in degre of arc. conceptu unit of time smaller than realiz on sundial were also used. there are refer to second as part of a lunar month in the write of natur philosoph of the middl ages, which were mathemat subdivis that could not be measur mechanically. === fraction of solar day === the earliest mechan clock which appear start in the centuri had display that divid the hour into halves, thirds, quarter and sometim even parts, but never by in fact, the hour was not common divid in minut as it was not uniform in duration. it was not practic for timekeep to consid minut until the first mechan clock that display minut appear near the end of the century. mechan clock kept the mean time, as oppos to the appar time display by sundials. by that time, sexagesim divis of time were well establish in europe.th earliest clock to display second appear dure the last half of the century. the second becam accur measur with the develop of mechan clocks. the earliest spring-driven timepiec with a second hand which mark second is an unsign clock depict orpheus in the fremersdorf collection, date between and dure the quarter of the century, taqi al-din built a clock with mark everi minute. in jost b\u00fcrgi built a clock for william of hess that mark seconds. in tycho brahe redesign clock that had display onli minut at his observatori so they also display seconds, even though those second were not accurate. in tycho complain that his four clock disagre by plus or minus four seconds.in dutch scientist christiaan huygen invent the first pendulum clock. it had a pendulum length of just under a meter which gave it a swing of one second, and an escap that tick everi second. it was the first clock that could accur keep time in seconds. by the year later, john harrison maritim chronomet could keep time accur to within one second in days. in gauss propos use the second as the base unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second system of units. the british associ for the advanc of scienc (baas) in state that \"all men of scienc are agre to use the second of mean solar time as the unit of time.\" baa formal propos the cgs system in although this system was gradual replac over the next year by mks units. both the cgs and mks system use the same second as their base unit of time. mks was adopt intern dure the defin the second as of a mean solar day. === fraction of an ephemeri year === some time in the late quartz crystal oscil clock with an oper frequenc of khz advanc to keep time with accuraci better than part in over an oper period of a day. it becam appar that a consensus of such clock kept better time than the rotat of the earth. metrologist also knew that earth orbit around the sun (a year) was much more stabl than earth rotation. this led to propos as earli as to defin the second as a fraction of a year. the earth motion was describ in newcomb tabl of the sun which provid a formula for estim the motion of the sun relat to the epoch base on astronom observ made between and this result in adopt of an ephemeri time scale express in unit of the sider year at that epoch by the iau in this extrapol timescal bring the observ posit of the celesti bodi into accord with newtonian dynam theori of their motion. in the tropic year, consid more fundament than the sider year, was chosen by the iau as the unit of time. the tropic year in the definit was not measur but calcul from a formula describ a mean tropic year that decreas linear over time. in the second was redefin in term of a year relat to that epoch. the second was thus defin as \"the fraction of the tropic year for januari at hour ephemeri time\". this definit was adopt as part of the intern system of unit in === \"atomic\" second === but even the best mechanical, electr motor and quartz crystal-bas clock develop discrep from environment conditions. far better for timekeep is the natur and exact \"vibration\" in an energ atom. the frequenc of vibrat (i.e., radiation) is veri specif depend on the type of atom and how it is excited. sinc the second has been defin as exact \"the durat of period of the radiat correspond to the transit between the two hyperfin level of the ground state of the atom\" (at a temperatur of k). this length of a second was select to correspond exact to the length of the ephemeri second previous defined. atom clock use such a frequenc to measur second by count cycl per second at that frequency. radiat of this kind is one of the most stabl and reproduc phenomena of nature. the current generat of atom clock is accur to within one second in a few hundr million years. atom clock now set the length of a second and the time standard for the world. == si multipl == si prefix are common use for time shorter than one second, but rare for multipl of a second. instead,

    "the roentgen or r\u00f6ntgen symbol r is a legaci unit of measur for the exposur of x ray and gamma ray and is defin as the electr charg freed by such radiat in a specifi volum of air divid by the mass of that air statcoulomb per kilogram in it was adopt as the first intern measur quantiti for ionis radiat to be defin for radiat protect as it was then the most easili replic method of measur air ioniz by use ion chamber it is name after the german physicist wilhelm r\u00f6ntgen who discov x ray howev although this was a major step forward in standardis radiat measur the roentgen has the disadvantag that it is onli a measur of air ionis and not a direct measur of radiat absorpt in other materi such as differ form of human tissu for instanc one roentgen deposit gray rad of absorb dose in dri air or gy rad in soft tissu one roentgen of x ray may deposit anywher from to gy to rad) in bone depend on the beam energy.a the scienc of radiat dosimetri developed, it was realis that the ionis effect, and henc tissu damage, was link to the energi absorbed, not just radiat exposure. consequ new radiometr unit for radiat protect were defin which took this into account. in the intern commiss on radiat unit and measur (icru) recommend the rad, equal to erg/g, as the unit of measur of the new radiat quantiti absorb dose. the rad was express in coher cgs units. in the unit gray was name as the si unit of absorb dose. one gray is equal to j/kg (i.e. rad). additionally, a new quantity, kerma, was defin for air ionis as the exposur quantiti for instrument calibration, and from this the absorb dose can be calcul use known coeffici for specif target materials. today, for radiat protection, the modern units, absorb dose for energi absorpt and the equival dose (sievert) for stochast effect, are overwhelm used, and the roentgen is rare used. the intern committe for weight and measur (cipm) has never accept the use of the roentgen. the roentgen has been metrolog redefin over the years. it was last defin by the us nation institut of standard and technolog (nist) in as c/kg, with a recommend that the definit be given in everi document where the roentgen is used. == histori == the roentgen has it root in the villard unit defin in by the american roentgen ray societi as \"the quantiti of radiat which liber by ionis one esu of electr per of air under normal condit of

c/kg this definit was use under differ name (e, r, and german unit of radiation) for the next years. in the meantime, the french roentgen was given a differ definit which amount to german r. === icr definit === in the intern congress of radiolog (icr) defin the roentgen as \"the quantiti of x-radiat which, when the secondari electron are fulli utilis and the wall effect of the chamber is avoided, produc in cc of atmospher air at \u00b0c and cm of mercuri pressur such a degre of conduct that esu of charg is measur at satur current.\" the state cc of air would have a mass of mg at the condit given, so in the icr rewrot this definit in term of this mass of air instead of volume, temperatur and pressure. the definit was also extend to gamma rays, but later cap at mev in === gost definit === the ussr all-union committe of standard (gost) had meanwhil adopt a signific differ definit of the roentgen in gost standard defin it as \"the physic dose of x-ray which produc charg each of one electrostat unit in magnitud per of irradi volum in air at \u00b0c and normal atmospher pressur when ioniz is complete.\" the distinct of physic dose from dose caus confusion, some of which may have led cantril and parker report that the roentgen had becom shorthand for erg per gram gy) of tissue. they name this deriv quantiti the roentgen equival physic (rep) to distinguish it from the icr roentgen. === icrp definit === the introduct of the roentgen measur unit, which reli upon measur the ionis of air, replac earlier less accur practic that reli on time exposure, film exposure, or fluorescence. this led the way to set exposur limits, and the nation council on radiat protect and measur of the unit state establish the first formal dose limit in as roentgen per day. the intern x-ray and radium protect committee, now known as the intern commiss on radiolog protect (icrp) soon follow with a limit of roentgen per day in in the icrp reduc their recommend limit to roentgen per week for whole-bodi exposure. the intern commiss on radiat unit and measur (icru) took over the definit of the roentgen in defin it as \"the quantiti of x or \u03b3-radiat such that the associ corpuscular emiss per gram of air produces, in air, ion carri electrostat unit of quantiti of electr of either sign.\" the mev cap was no longer part of the definition, but the degrad use of this unit at high beam energi was mention in the accompani text. in the meantime, the new concept of roentgen equival man (rem) had been developed. start in the icrp began to publish their recommend in term of rem, and the roentgen fell into disuse. the medic imag communiti still has a need for ioniz measurements, but they gradual convert to use c/kg as legaci equip was replaced. the icru recommend redefin the roentgen to be exact \u00d7 c/kg in === european union === in the european econom community, in direct catalogu the unit of measur that could be use \"for ... public health ... purposes\". the direct includ the curie, rad, rem, and roentgen as permiss units, but requir that the use of the rad, rem and roentgen be review befor decemb this document defin the roentgen as exact \u00d7 c/kg, as per the icru recommendation. direct publish in decemb which replac direct explicit catalogu the gray, becquerel, and sievert for this purpos and requir that the curie, rad, rem and roentgen be phase out by decemb === nist definit === today the roentgen is rare used, and the intern committe for weight and measur (cipm) never accept the use of the roentgen. from to the us nist translat of the si brochur state that the cipm temporarili accept the use of the roentgen (and other radiolog units) with si unit sinc however, the onli relat cipm decis shown in the appendix are with regard to the curi in the nist brochur defin the roentgen as \u00d7 c/kg, to be employ with exposur of x or \u03b3 radiation, but did not state the medium to be ionized. the cipm current si brochur exclud the roentgen from the tabl of non-si unit accept for use with the si. the us nist clarifi in that it was provid it own interpret of the si system, wherebi it accept the roentgen for use in the us with the si, while recogn that the cipm did not. by then, the limit to x and \u03b3 radiat had been dropped. nist recommend defin the roentgen in everi document where this unit is used. the continu use of the roentgen is strong discourag by the nist. == develop of replac radiometr quantiti == although a conveni quantiti to measur with an air ion chamber, the roentgen had the disadvantag that it was not a direct measur of either the intens of x-ray or their absorption, but rather was a measur of the ionis effect of x-ray in a specif circumstance; which was dri air at \u00b0c and standard atmospher of pressure.becaus of this the roentgen had a variabl relationship to the amount of energi absorb dose per unit mass in the target material, as differ materi have differ absorpt characteristics. as the scienc of radiat dosimetri developed, this was seen as a serious shortcoming. in loui harold gray, who had been studi the effect of neutron damag on human tissue, togeth with william valentin mayneord and the radiobiologist john read, publish a paper in which a unit of measure, dub the \"gram roentgen\" (symbol: gr) defin as \"that amount of neutron radiat which produc an increment in energi in unit volum of tissu equal to the increment of energi produc in unit volum of water by one roentgen of radiation\" was proposed. this unit was found to be equival to erg in air. in the icru recommend the rad, equal to erg/g, as the new unit of measur of absorb radiation. the rad was express in coher cgs units.in the late the general confer on weight and measur (cgpm) invit the icru to join other scientif bodi to work with the intern committe for weight and measur (cipm) in the develop of a system of unit that could be use consist over mani disciplines. this body, initi known as the \"commiss for the system of units\", renam in as the \"consult committe for units\" (ccu), was respons for overse the develop of the intern system of unit (si). at the same time it was becom increas obvious that the definit of the roentgen was unsound, and in it was redefined. the ccu decid to defin the si unit of absorb radiat in term of energi per unit mass, which in mks unit was j/kg. this was confirm in by the cgpm, and the unit was name the \"gray\" in honour of loui harold gray, who had die in the gray was equal to rad. the definit of the roentgen had had the attract of be relat simpl to defin for photon in air, but the gray is independ of the primari ioniz radiat type, and can be use for both kerma and absorb dose in a wide rang of matter.when measur absorb dose in a human due to extern

defin terminolog == jame thomson, the brother of lord kelvin, introduc the term torqu into english scientif literatur in however, torqu is refer to use differ vocabulari depend on geograph locat and field of study. this articl follow the definit use in us physic in it usag of the word torque. in the uk and in us mechan engineering, torqu is refer to as moment of force, usual shorten to moment. these term are interchang in us physic and uk physic terminology, unlik in us mechan engineering, where the term torqu is use for the close relat \"result moment of a couple\". === torqu and moment in the us mechan engin terminolog === in us mechan engineering, torqu is defin mathemat as the rate of chang of angular momentum of an object (in physic it is call \"net torque\"). the definit of torqu state that one or both of the angular veloc or the moment of inertia of an object are changing. moment is the general term use for the tendenc of one or more appli forc to rotat an object about an axis, but not necessarili to chang the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is call torqu in physics). for example, a rotat forc appli to a shaft caus acceleration, such as a drill bit acceler from rest, result in a moment call a torque. by contrast, a later forc on a beam produc a moment (call a bend moment), but sinc the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bend moment is not call a torque. similar with ani forc coupl on an object that has no chang to it angular momentum, such moment is also not call a torque. == definit and relat to angular momentum == a forc appli perpendicular to a lever multipli by it distanc from the lever fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is it torque. a forc of three newton appli two meter from the fulcrum, for example, exert the same torqu as a forc of one newton appli six metr from the fulcrum. the direct of the torqu can be determin by use the right hand grip rule: if the finger of the right hand are curl from the direct of the lever arm to the direct of the force, then the thumb point in the direct of the torque.mor generally, the torqu on a point particl (which has the posit r in some refer frame) can be defin as the cross product: \u03c4 = r \u00d7 f , {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}=\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} ,} where r is the particl posit vector relat to the fulcrum, and f is the forc act on the particle. the magnitud \u03c4 of the torqu is given by \u03c4 = r f sin \u2061 \u03b8 , {\\displaystyl \\tau =rf\\sin \\theta ,\\!} where r is the distanc from the axi of rotat to the particle, f is the magnitud of the forc applied, and \u03b8 is the angl between the posit and forc vectors. alternatively, \u03c4 = r f \u22a5 , {\\displaystyl \\tau =rf_{\\perp },} where f\u22a5 is the amount of forc direct perpendicular to the posit of the particle. ani forc direct parallel to the particl posit vector doe not produc a torque.it follow from the properti of the cross product that the torqu vector is perpendicular to both the posit and forc vectors. conversely, the torqu vector defin the plane in which the posit and forc vector lie. the result torqu vector direct is determin by the right-hand rule.th net torqu on a bodi determin the rate of chang of the bodi angular momentum, \u03c4 = d l d t {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}} where l is the angular momentum vector and t is time. for the motion of a point particle, l = i \u03c9 , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {l} =i{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }},} where i is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the orbit angular veloc pseudovector. it follow that \u03c4 n e t = d l d t = d ( i \u03c9 ) d t = i d \u03c9 d t + d i d t \u03c9 = i \u03b1 + d ( m r ) d t \u03c9 = i \u03b1 + r p | | \u03c9 , {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}_{\\mathrm {net} }={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} (i{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }})}{\\mathrm {d} t}}=i{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}+{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} i}{\\mathrm {d} t}}{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}=i{\\boldsymbol {\\alpha }}+{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {d} t}}{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}=i{\\boldsymbol {\\alpha {\\omega }},} where \u03b1 is the angular acceler of the particle, and p|| is the radial compon of it linear momentum. this equat is the rotat analogu of newton second law for point particles, and is valid for ani type of trajectory. note that although forc and acceler are alway parallel and direct proportional, the torqu \u03c4 need not be parallel or direct proport to the angular acceler \u03b1. this aris from the fact that although mass is alway conserved, the moment of inertia in general is not. === proof of the equival of definit === the definit of angular momentum for a singl point particl is: l = r \u00d7 p {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {l} =\\mathbf {r} \\time {\\boldsymbol {p}}} where p is the particl linear momentum and r is the posit vector from the origin. the time-deriv of this is: d l d t = r \u00d7 d p d t + d r d t \u00d7 p . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {r} \\time {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {p}}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}+{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {r} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}\\time {\\boldsymbol {p}}.} this result can easili be proven by split the vector into compon and appli the product rule. now use the definit of forc f = d p d t {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {f} ={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {p}}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}} (whether or not mass is constant) and the definit of veloc d r d t = v {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {r} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {v} } d l d t = r \u00d7 f + v \u00d7 p . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} +\\mathbf {v} \\time {\\boldsymbol {p}}.} the cross product of momentum p {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {p}}} with it associ veloc v {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {v} } is zero becaus veloc and momentum are parallel, so the second term vanishes. by definition, torqu \u03c4 = r \u00d7 f. therefore, torqu on a particl is equal to the first deriv of it angular momentum with respect to time. if multipl forc are applied, newton second law instead read fnet = ma, and it follow that d l d t = r \u00d7 f n e t = \u03c4 n e t . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {l} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} _{\\mathrm {net} }={\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}_{\\mathrm {net} }.} this is a general proof for point particles. the proof can be general to a system of point particl by appli the abov proof to each of the point particl and then sum over all the point particles. similarly, the proof can be general to a continu mass by appli the abov proof to each point within the mass, and then integr over the entir mass. == unit == torqu has the dimens of forc time distance, symbol although those fundament dimens are the same as that for energi or work, offici si literatur suggest use the unit newton metr (n\u22c5m) and never the joule. the unit newton metr is proper denot n\u22c5m.the tradit imperi and u.s. customari unit for torqu are the pound foot (lbf-ft), or for small valu the pound inch (lbf-in). confusingly, in us practic torqu is most common refer to as the foot-pound (denot as either lb-ft or ft-lb) and the inch-pound (denot as in-lb). practition depend on context and the hyphen in the abbrevi to know that these refer to torqu and not to energi or moment of mass (as the symbol ft-lb would proper imply). == special case and other fact == === moment arm formula === a veri use special case, often given as the definit of torqu in field other than physics, is as follows: \u03c4 = ( moment arm ) ( forc ) . {\\displaystyl \\tau =({\\text{moment arm}})({\\text{force}}).} the construct of the \"moment arm\" is shown in the figur to the right, along with the vector r and f mention above. the problem with this definit is that it doe not give the direct of the torqu but onli the magnitude, and henc it is difficult to use in three-dimension cases. if the forc is perpendicular to the displac vector r, the moment arm will be equal to the distanc to the centre, and torqu will be a maximum for the given force. the equat for the magnitud of a torque, aris from a perpendicular force: \u03c4 = ( distanc to centr ) ( forc ) . {\\displaystyl \\tau =({\\text{dist to centre}})({\\text{force}}).} for example, if a person place a forc of n at the termin end of a wrench that is m long (or a forc of n exact m from the twist point of a wrench of ani length), the torqu will be n\u22c5m \u2013 assum that the person move the wrench by appli forc in the plane of movement and perpendicular to the wrench. === static equilibrium === for an object to be in static equilibrium, not onli must the sum of the forc be zero, but also the sum of the torqu (moments) about ani point. for a two-dimension situat with horizont and vertic forces, the sum of the forc requir is two equations: \u03c3h = and \u03c3v = and the torqu a third equation: \u03c3\u03c4 = that is, to solv static determin equilibrium problem in two-dimensions, three equat are used. === net forc versus torqu === when the net forc on the system is zero, the torqu measur from ani point in space is the same. for example, the torqu on a current-carri loop in a uniform magnet field is the same regardless of your point of reference. if the net forc f {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {f} } is not zero, and \u03c4 {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau is the torqu measur from r {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {r} , then the torqu measur from r {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {r} is \u2026 \u03c4 = \u03c4 + ( r \u2212 r ) \u00d7 f {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau {\\tau {r} {r} \\mathbf {f} } == machin torqu == torqu form part of the basic specif of an engine: the power output of an engin is express as it torqu multipli by it rotat speed of the axis. internal-combust engin produc use torqu onli over a limit rang of rotat speed (typic from around rpm for a small car). one can measur the vari torqu output over that rang with a dynamometer, and show it as a torqu curve. steam engin and electr motor tend to produc maximum torqu close to zero rpm, with the torqu diminish as rotat speed rise (due to increas friction and other constraints). reciproc steam-engin and electr motor can start heavi load from zero rpm without a clutch. == relationship between torque, power, and energi == if a forc is allow to act through a distance, it is do mechan work. similarly, if torqu is allow to act through a rotat distance, it is do work. mathematically, for rotat about a fix axi through the center of mass, the work w can be express as w = \u222b \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03c4 d \u03b8 , {\\displaystyl w=\\int _{\\theta \\ \\mathrm {d} \\theta ,} where \u03c4 is torque, and and repres (respectively) the initi and final angular posit of the body. === proof === the work done by a variabl forc act over a finit linear displac s {\\displaystyl s} is given by integr the forc with respect to an element linear displac d s \u2192 {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {s}}} w = \u222b s s f \u2192 \u22c5 d s \u2192 {\\displaystyl w=\\int {f}}\\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {s}}} however, the infinitesim linear displac d s \u2192 {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {s}}} is relat to a correspond angular displac d \u03b8 \u2192 {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {\\theta }}} and the radius vector r \u2192 {\\displaystyl {\\vec

s s f \u2192 \u22c5 d \u03b8 \u2192 \u00d7 r \u2192 {\\displaystyl w=\\int {f}}\\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {\\theta }}\\time {\\vec {r}}} the express f \u2192 \u22c5 d \u03b8 \u2192 \u00d7 r \u2192 {\\displaystyl {\\vec {f}}\\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {\\theta }}\\time {\\vec {r}}} is a scalar tripl product given by [ f \u2192 d \u03b8 \u2192 r \u2192 ] {\\displaystyl \\left[{\\vec {f}}\\,\\mathrm {d} {\\vec {\\theta }}\\,{\\vec {r}}\\right]} . an altern express for the same scalar tripl product is [ f \u2192 d \u03b8 \u2192 r \u2192 ] = r \u2192 \u00d7 f \u2192 \u22c5 d \u03b8

\u03c4 \u2192 = r \u2192 \u00d7 f \u2192 {\\displaystyl {\\vec {\\tau }}={\\vec {r}}\\time {\\vec {f}}} correspond substitut in the express of work gives, w = \u222b s s \u03c4 \u2192 \u22c5 d \u03b8 \u2192 {\\displaystyl w=\\int {\\tau }}\\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {\\theta }}} sinc the paramet of integr has been chang from linear displac to angular displacement, the limit of the integr also chang correspondingly, give w = \u222b \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03c4 \u2192 \u22c5 d \u03b8 \u2192 {\\displaystyl w=\\int _{\\theta {\\tau }}\\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\vec {\\theta }}} if the torqu and the angular displac are in the same direction, then the scalar product reduc to a product of magnitudes; i.e., \u03c4 \u2192 \u22c5 d \u03b8 \u2192 = | \u03c4 \u2192 | | d \u03b8 \u2192 | cos \u2061 = \u03c4 d

\u222b \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03c4 d \u03b8 {\\displaystyl w=\\int _{\\theta \\,\\mathrm {d} \\theta } it follow from the work-energi theorem that w also repres the chang in the rotat kinet energi er of the body, given by e r = i \u03c9 , {\\displaystyl e_{\\mathrm {r} }={\\tfrac where i is the moment of inertia of the bodi and \u03c9 is it angular speed.pow is the work per unit time, given by p = \u03c4

the scalar product. algebraically, the equat may be rearrang to comput torqu for a given angular speed and power output. note that the power inject by the torqu depend onli on the instantan angular speed \u2013 not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remain constant while the torqu is be appli (this is equival to the linear case where the power inject by a forc depend onli on the instantan speed \u2013 not on the result acceleration, if any). in practice, this relationship can be observ in bicycles: bicycl are typic compos of two road wheels, front and rear gear (refer to as sprockets) mesh with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechan if the bicycl transmiss system allow multipl gear ratio to be use (i.e. multi-spe bicycle), all of which attach to the frame. a cyclist, the person who ride the bicycle, provid the input power by turn pedals, therebi crank the front sprocket (common refer to as chainring). the input power provid by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadenc (i.e. the number of pedal revolut per minute) and the torqu on spindl of the bicycl crankset. the bicycl drivetrain transmit the input power to the road wheel, which in turn convey the receiv power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. depend on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is convert to a (torque, rpm)output pair. by use a larger rear gear, or by switch to a lower gear in multi-spe bicycles, angular speed of the road wheel is decreas while the torqu is increased, product of which (i.e. power) doe not change. consist unit must be used. for metric si units, power is watts, torqu is newton metr and angular speed is radian per second (not rpm and not revolut per second). also, the unit newton metr is dimension equival to the joule, which is the unit of energy. however, in the case of torque, the unit is assign to a vector, wherea for energy, it is assign to a scalar. this mean that the dimension equival of the newton metr and the joul may be appli in the former, but not in the latter case. this problem is address in orient analysi which treat radian as a base unit rather than a dimensionless unit. === convers to other unit === a convers factor may be necessari when use differ unit of power or torque. for example, if rotat speed (revolut per time) is use in place of angular speed (radian per time), we multipli by a factor of radian per revolution. in the follow formulas, p is power, \u03c4 is torque, and \u03bd (greek letter nu) is rotat speed. p = \u03c4 \u22c5 \u03c0 \u22c5 \u03bd {\\displaystyl p=\\tau \\cdot \\cdot \\nu } show units: p ( w ) = \u03c4 ( n \u22c5 m ) \u22c5 \u03c0 ( r a d / r e v ) \u22c5 \u03bd ( r e v / s e c ) {\\displaystyl p({\\rm {w}})=\\tau {\\rm {(n\\cdot m)}}\\cdot {\\rm {(rad/rev)}}\\cdot \\nu {\\rm {(rev/sec)}}} divid by second per minut give us the following. p ( w ) = \u03c4 ( n \u22c5 m ) \u22c5 \u03c0 ( r a d / r e v ) \u22c5 \u03bd ( r p m ) {\\displaystyl p({\\rm {w}})={\\frac {\\tau {\\rm {(n\\cdot m)}}\\cdot {\\rm {(rad/rev)}}\\cdot \\nu {\\rm where rotat speed is in revolut per minut (rpm). some peopl (e.g., american automot engineers) use horsepow (mechanical) for power, foot-pound (lbf\u22c5ft) for torqu and rpm for rotat speed. this result in the formula chang to: p ( h p ) = \u03c4 ( l b f \u22c5 f t ) \u22c5 \u03c0 ( r a d / r e v ) \u22c5 \u03bd ( r p m ) , . {\\displaystyl p({\\rm {hp}})={\\frac {\\tau {\\rm {(lbf\\cdot ft)}}\\cdot {\\rm {(rad/rev)}}\\cdot \\nu ({\\rm the constant below (in foot-pound per minute) chang with the definit of the horsepower; for example, use metric horsepower, it becom approxim the use of other unit (e.g., btu per hour for power) would requir a differ custom convers factor. === deriv === for a rotat object, the linear distanc cover at the circumfer of rotat is the product of the radius with the angl covered. that is: linear distanc = radius \u00d7 angular distance. and by definition, linear distanc = linear speed \u00d7 time = radius \u00d7 angular speed \u00d7 time. by the definit of torque: torqu = radius \u00d7 force. we can rearrang this to determin forc = torqu \u00f7 radius. these two valu can be substitut into the definit of power: power = forc \u22c5 linear distanc time = ( torqu r ) \u22c5 ( r \u22c5 angular speed \u22c5 t ) t = torqu \u22c5 angular speed . {\\displaystyl

speed}}.\\end{aligned}}} the radius r and time t have drop out of the equation. however, angular speed must be in radian per unit of time, by the assum direct relationship between linear speed and angular speed at the begin of the derivation. if the rotat speed is measur in revolut per unit of time, the linear speed and distanc are increas proportion by in the abov deriv to give: power = torqu \u22c5 \u03c0 \u22c5 rotat speed . {\\displaystyl {\\text{power}}={\\text{torque}}\\cdot \\cdot {\\text{rot speed}}.\\,} if torqu is in newton metr and rotat speed in revolut per second, the abov equat give power in newton metr per second or watts. if imperi unit are used, and if torqu is in pounds-forc feet and rotat speed in revolut per minute, the abov equat give power in foot pounds-forc per minute. the horsepow form of the equat is then deriv by appli the convers factor ft\u22c5lbf/min per horsepower: power = torqu \u22c5 \u03c0 \u22c5 rotat speed \u22c5 ft \u22c5 lbf min \u22c5

moments, also known as varignon theorem (not to be confus with the geometr theorem of the same name) state that the sum of torqu due to sever forc appli to a singl point is equal to the torqu due to the sum (resultant) of the forces. mathematically, this follow from: ( r \u00d7 f ) + ( r \u00d7 f ) + \u22ef = r \u00d7 ( f + f + \u22ef ) . {\\displaystyl (\\mathbf {r} \\time \\mathbf {f} {r}

the second mach number is mach instead of mach (or machs). this is somewhat reminisc of the earli modern ocean sound unit mark (a synonym for fathom), which was also unit-first, and may have influenc the use of the term mach. in the decad preced faster-than-sound human flight, aeronaut engin refer to the speed of sound as mach number, never mach == overview == mach number is a measur of the compress characterist of fluid flow: the fluid (air) behav under the influenc of compress in a similar manner at a given mach number, regardless of other variables. as model in the intern standard atmosphere, dri air at mean sea level, standard temperatur of \u00b0c \u00b0f), the speed of sound is meter per second ft/s; mph; kn). the speed of sound is not a constant; in a gas, it increas proport to the squar root of the absolut temperature, and sinc atmospher temperatur general decreas with increas altitud between sea level and meter ft), the speed of sound also decreases. for example, the standard atmospher model laps temperatur to \u00b0c \u00b0f) at meter ft) altitude, with a correspond speed of sound (mach of meter per second ft/s; mph; kn), of the sea level value. == classif of mach regim == while the term subson and supersonic, in the purest sense, refer to speed below and abov the local speed of sound respectively, aerodynamicist often use the same term to talk about particular rang of mach values. this occur becaus of the presenc of a transon regim around flight (free stream) m = where approxim of the navier-stok equat use for subson design no longer apply; the simplest explan is that the flow around an airfram local begin to exceed m = even though the free stream mach number is below this value. meanwhile, the superson regim is usual use to talk about the set of mach number for which linearis theori may be used, where for exampl the (air) flow is not chemic reacting, and where heat-transf between air and vehicl may be reason neglect in calculations. in the follow table, the regim or rang of mach valu are refer to, and not the pure mean of the word subson and supersonic. generally, nasa defin high hyperson as ani mach number from to and re-entri speed as anyth greater than mach aircraft oper in this regim includ the space shuttl and various space plane in development. == high-spe flow around object == flight can be rough classifi in six categories: for comparison: the requir speed for low earth orbit is approxim km/s = mach in air at high altitudes. at transon speeds, the flow field around the object includ both sub- and superson parts. the transon period begin when first zone of m > flow appear around the object. in case of an airfoil (such as an aircraft wing), this typic happen abov the wing. superson flow can deceler back to subson onli in a normal shock; this typic happen befor the trail edge. as the speed increases, the zone of m > flow increas toward both lead and trail edges. as m = is reach and passed, the normal shock reach the trail edg and becom a weak obliqu shock: the flow deceler over the shock, but remain supersonic. a normal shock is creat ahead of the object, and the onli subson zone in the flow field is a small area around the object lead edge. fig. mach number in transon airflow around an airfoil; m < (a) and m > (b). when an aircraft exceed mach (i.e. the sound barrier), a larg pressur differ is creat just in front of the aircraft. this abrupt pressur difference, call a shock wave, spread backward and outward from the aircraft in a cone shape (a so-cal mach cone). it is this shock wave that caus the sonic boom heard as a fast move aircraft travel overhead. a person insid the aircraft will not hear this. the higher the speed, the more narrow the cone; at just over m = it is hard a cone at all, but closer to a slight concav plane. at fulli superson speed, the shock wave start to take it cone shape and flow is either complet supersonic, or (in case of a blunt object), onli a veri small subson flow area remain between the object nose and the shock wave it creat ahead of itself. (in the case of a sharp object, there is no air between the nose and the shock wave: the shock wave start from the nose.) as the mach number increases, so doe the strength of the shock wave and the mach cone becom increas narrow. as the fluid flow cross the shock wave, it speed is reduc and temperature, pressure, and densiti increase. the stronger the shock, the greater the changes. at high enough mach number the temperatur increas so much over the shock that ioniz and dissoci of gas molecul behind the shock wave begin. such flow are call hypersonic. it is clear that ani object travel at hyperson speed will likewis be expos to the same extrem temperatur as the gas behind the nose shock wave, and henc choic of heat-resist materi becom important. == high-spe flow in a channel == as a flow in a channel becom supersonic, one signific chang take place. the conserv of mass flow rate lead one to expect that contract the flow channel would increas the flow speed (i.e. make the channel narrow result in faster air flow) and at subson speed this hold true. however, onc the flow becom supersonic, the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed: expand the channel actual increas the speed. the obvious result is that in order to acceler a flow to supersonic, one need a convergent-diverg nozzle, where the converg section acceler the flow to sonic speeds, and the diverg section continu the acceleration. such nozzl are call de laval nozzl and in extrem case they are abl to reach hyperson speed (mach km/h; mph) at \u00b0c). an aircraft machmet or electron flight inform system (efis) can display mach number deriv from stagnat pressur (pitot tube) and static pressure. == calcul == the mach number at which an aircraft is fli can be calcul by m = u c {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {m} ={\\frac {u}{c}}} where: m is the mach number u is veloc of the move aircraft and c is the speed of sound at the given altitud (more proper temperature)not that the dynam pressur can be found as: q = \u03b3 p m {\\displaystyl q={\\frac {\\gamma {m} assum air to be an ideal gas, the formula to comput mach number in a subson compress flow is deriv from bernoulli equat for m < m = \u03b3 \u2212 [ ( q c p + ) \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 ] {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {m} ={\\sqrt {{\\frac {\\gamma and the speed of sound vari with the thermodynam temperatur as: c = \u03b3 \u22c5 r \u2217 \u22c5 t , {\\displaystyl c={\\sqrt {\\gamma \\cdot r_{*}\\cdot t}},} where: qc is impact pressur (dynam pressure) and p is static pressur \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\gamma \\,} is the ratio of specif heat of a gas at a constant pressur to heat at a constant volum for air) r \u2217 {\\displaystyl r_{*}} is the specif gas constant for air.th formula to comput mach number in a superson compress flow is deriv from the rayleigh superson pitot equation: p t p = [ \u03b3 + m ] \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2212 \u22c5 [ \u03b3 + \u2212 \u03b3 + \u03b3 m ] \u03b3 \u2212 {\\displaystyl {\\frac {p_{t}}{p}}=\\left[{\\frac {\\gamma {m} {\\gamma }{\\gamma \\left[{\\frac {\\gamma \\,\\mathrm {m} === calcul mach number from pitot tube pressur === mach number is a function of temperatur and true airspeed. aircraft flight instruments, however, oper use pressur differenti to comput mach number, not temperature. assum air to be an ideal gas, the formula to comput mach number in a subson compress flow is found from bernoulli equat for m < (above): m = [ ( q c p + ) \u2212 ] {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {m} ={\\sqrt the formula to comput mach number in a superson compress flow can be found from the rayleigh superson pitot equat (above) use paramet for air: m \u2248 ( q c p + ) ( \u2212 m ) {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {m} \\approx {\\left({\\frac {m} where: qc is the dynam pressur measur behind a normal shock.a can be seen, m appear on both side of the equation, and for practic purpos a root-find algorithm must be use for a numer solut (the equat solut is a root of a polynomi in and, though some of these may be solv explicitly, the abel\u2013ruffini theorem guarante that there exist no general form for the root of these polynomials). it is first determin whether m is inde greater than by calcul m from the subson equation. if m is greater than at that point, then the valu of m from the subson equat is use as the initi condit for fix point iter of the superson equation, which usual converg veri rapidly. alternatively, newton method can also be used. == see also == critic mach number machmet ramjet \u2013 jet engin design to oper at superson speed scramjet \u2013 jet engin where combust take place in superson airflow speed of sound \u2013 distanc travel dure a unit of time by a sound wave propag through an elast medium true airspe order of magnitud (speed) == note == == extern link == gas dynam toolbox calcul mach number and normal shock wave paramet for mixtur of perfect and imperfect gases. nasa page on mach number interact calcul for mach number. newbyt standard atmospher calcul and speed convert",
    "the bit is the most basic unit of inform in comput and digit communic the name is a contract of binari digit the bit repres a logic state with one of two possibl valu these valu are most common repres as either or but other represent such as true fals yes no or on off are common the correspond between these valu and the physic state of the under storag or devic is a matter of convent and differ assign may be use even within the same devic or program it may be physic implement with a two state devic the symbol for the binari digit is either bit per recommend by the iec standard or the lowercas charact b as recommend by the ieee and ieee std standard a contigu group of binari digit is common call a bit string a bit vector or a single-dimension (or multi-dimensional) bit array. a group of eight binari digit is call one byte, but histor the size of the byte is not strict defined. frequently, half, full, doubl and quadrupl word consist of a number of byte which is a low power of two. in inform theory, one bit is the inform entropi of a binari random variabl that is or with equal probability, or the inform that is gain when the valu of such a variabl becom known. as a unit of information, the bit is also known as a shannon, name after claud e. shannon. == histori == the encod of data by discret bit was use in the punch card invent by basil bouchon and jean-baptist falcon develop by joseph mari jacquard and later adopt by semyon korsakov, charl babbage, hermann hollerith, and earli comput manufactur like ibm. a variant of that idea was the perfor paper tape. in all those systems, the medium (card or tape) conceptu carri an array of hole positions; each posit could be either punch through or not, thus carri one bit of information. the encod of text by bit was also use in mors code and earli digit communic machin such as teletyp and stock ticker machin ralph hartley suggest the use of a logarithm measur of inform in claud e. shannon first use the word \"bit\" in his semin paper \"a mathemat theori of communication\". he attribut it origin to john w. tukey, who had written a bell lab memo on januari in which he contract \"binari inform digit\" to simpli \"bit\". vannevar bush had written in of \"bit of information\" that could be store on the punch card use in the mechan comput of that time. the first programm computer, built by konrad zuse, use binari notat for numbers. == physic represent == a bit can be store by a digit devic or other physic system that exist in either of two possibl distinct states. these may be the two stabl state of a flip-flop, two posit of an electr switch, two distinct voltag or current level allow by a circuit, two distinct level of light intensity, two direct of magnet or polarization, the orient of revers doubl strand dna, etc. bit can be implement in sever forms. in most modern comput devices, a bit is usual repres by an electr voltag or current pulse, or by the electr state of a flip-flop circuit. for devic use posit logic, a digit valu of (or a logic valu of true) is repres by a more posit voltag relat to the represent of the specif voltag are differ for differ logic famili and variat are permit to allow for compon age and nois immunity. for example, in transistor\u2013transistor logic (ttl) and compat circuits, digit valu and at the output of a devic are repres by no higher than volt and no lower than volts, respectively; while ttl input are specifi to recogn volt or below as and volt or abov as === transmiss and process === bit are transmit one at a time in serial transmission, and by a multipl number of bit in parallel transmission. a bitwis oper option process bit one at a time. data transfer rate are usual measur in decim si multipl of the unit bit per second (bit/s), such as kbit/s. === storag === in the earliest non-electron inform process devices, such as jacquard loom or babbag analyt engine, a bit was often store as the posit of a mechan lever or gear, or the presenc or absenc of a hole at a specif point of a paper card or tape. the first electr devic for discret logic (such as elev and traffic light control circuits, telephon switches, and konrad zuse computer) repres bit as the state of electr relay which could be either \"open\" or \"closed\". when relay were replac by vacuum tubes, start in the comput builder experi with a varieti of storag methods, such as pressur puls travel down a mercuri delay line, charg store on the insid surfac of a cathode-ray tube, or opaqu spot print on glass disc by photolithograph techniques. in the and these method were larg supplant by magnet storag devic such as magnet core memory, magnet tapes, drums, and disks, where a bit was repres by the polar of magnet of a certain area of a ferromagnet film, or by a chang in polar from one direct to the other. the same principl was later use in the magnet bubbl memori develop in the and is still found in various magnet strip item such as metro ticket and some credit cards. in modern semiconductor memory, such as dynam random-access memory, the two valu of a bit may be repres by two level of electr charg store in a capacitor. in certain type of programm logic array and read-on memory, a bit may be repres by the presenc or absenc of a conduct path at a certain point of a circuit. in optic discs, a bit is encod as the presenc or absenc of a microscop pit on a reflect surface. in one-dimension bar codes, bit are encod as the thick of altern black and white lines. == unit and symbol == the bit is not defin in the intern system of unit (si). however, the intern electrotechn commiss issu standard iec which specifi that the symbol for binari digit should be bit, and this should be use in all multiples, such as kbit, for kilobit. however, the lower-cas letter b is wide use as well and was recommend by the ieee standard in contrast, the upper case letter b is the standard and customari symbol for byte. === multipl bit === multipl bit may be express and repres in sever ways. for conveni of repres common reoccur group of bit in inform technology, sever unit of inform have tradit been used. the most common is the unit byte, coin by werner buchholz in june which histor was use to repres the group of bit use to encod a singl charact of text (until multibyt encod took over) in a comput and for this reason it was use as the basic address element in mani comput architectures. the trend in hardwar design converg on the most common implement of use eight bit per byte, as it is wide use today. however, becaus of the ambigu of reli on the under hardwar design, the unit octet was defin to explicit denot a sequenc of eight bits. comput usual manipul bit in group of a fix size, convent name \"words\". like the byte, the number of bit in a word also vari with the hardwar design, and is typic between and bits, or even more in some special computers. in the century, retail person or server comput have a word size of or bits. the intern system of unit defin a seri of decim prefix for multipl of standard unit which are common also use with the bit and the byte. the prefix kilo through yotta increment by multipl of and the correspond unit are the kilobit (kbit) through the yottabit (ybit). == inform capac and inform compress == when the inform capac of a storag system or a communic channel is present in bit or bit per second, this often refer to binari digits, which is a comput hardwar capac to store binari data or up or down, current or not, etc.). inform capac of a storag system is onli an upper bound to the quantiti of inform store therein. if the two possibl valu of one bit of storag are not equal likely, that bit of storag contain less than one bit of information. if the valu is complet predictable, then the read of that valu provid no inform at all (zero entrop bits, becaus no resolut of uncertainti occur and therefor no inform is available). if a comput file that use n bit of storag contain onli m < n bit of information, then that inform can in principl be encod in about m bits, at least on the average. this principl is the basi of data compress technology. use an analogy, the hardwar binari digit refer to the amount of storag space avail (like the number of bucket avail to store things), and the inform content the filling, which come in differ level of granular (fine or coarse, that is, compress or uncompress information). when the granular is finer\u2014when inform is more compressed\u2014th same bucket can hold more. for example, it is estim that the combin technolog capac of the world to store inform provid exabyt of hardwar digits. however, when this storag space is fill and the correspond content is optim compressed, this onli repres exabyt of information. when optim compressed, the result carri capac approach shannon inform or inform entropy. == bit-bas comput == certain bitwis comput processor instruct (such as bit set) oper at the level of manipul bit rather than manipul data interpret as an aggreg of bits. in the when bitmap comput display becam popular, some comput provid special bit block transfer instruct to set or copi the bit that correspond to a given rectangular area on the screen. in most comput and program languages, when a bit within a group of bits, such as a byte or word, is refer to, it is usual specifi by a number from upward correspond to it posit within the byte or word. however, can refer to either the most or least signific bit depend on the context. == other inform unit == similar to torqu and energi in physics; information-theoret inform and data storag size have the same dimension of unit of measurement, but there is in general no mean to adding, subtract or otherwis combin the unit mathematically. other unit of information, sometim use in inform theory, includ the natur digit also call a nat or nit and defin as e (\u2248 bits, where e is the base of the natur logarithms; and the dit, ban, or hartley, defin as (\u2248 bits. this value, slight less than may be understood becaus = \u2248 = three decim digit are slight less inform than ten binari digits, so one decim digit is slight less than binari digits. conversely, one bit of inform correspond to about ln (\u2248 nats, or (\u2248 hartleys. as with the invers ratio, this value, approxim but slight more, correspond to the fact that = ~ = ten binari digit are slight more inform than three decim digits, so one binari digit is slight more than decim digits. some author also defin a binit as an arbitrari inform unit equival to some fix but unspecifi number of bits. == see also == byte integ (comput science) primit data type trit (trinari digit) qubit (quantum bit) bitstream entropi (inform theory) baud rate (bit per second) binari

seen as a special case of volum for two-dimension regions.area can be defin through the use of axioms, defin it as a function of a collect of certain plane figur to the set of real numbers. it can be prove that such a function exists. == formal definit == an approach to defin what is meant by \"area\" is through axioms. \"area\" can be defin as a function from a collect m of a special kind of plane figur (term measur sets) to the set of real numbers, which satisfi the follow properties: for all s in m, a(s) \u2265 if s and t are in m then so are s \u222a t and s \u2229 t, and also a(s\u222at) = a(s) + a(t) \u2212 a(s\u2229t). if s and t are in m with s \u2286 t then t \u2212 s is in m and a(t\u2212s) = a(t) \u2212 a(s). if a set s is in m and s is congruent to t then t is also in m and a(s) = a(t). everi rectangl r is in m. if the rectangl has length h and breadth k then a(r) = hk. let q be a set enclos between two step region s and t. a step region is form from a finit union of adjac rectangl rest on a common base, i.e. s \u2286 q \u2286 t. if there is a uniqu number c such that a(s) \u2264 c \u2264 a(t) for all such step region s and t, then a(q) = c.it can be prove that such an area function actual exists. == unit == everi unit of length has a correspond unit of area, name the area of a squar with the given side length. thus area can be measur in squar metr squar centimetr squar millimetr squar kilometr squar feet squar yard squar mile and so forth. algebraically, these unit can be thought of as the squar of the correspond length units. the si unit of area is the squar metre, which is consid an si deriv unit. === convers === calcul of the area of a squar whose length and width are metr would be: metr \u00d7 metr = so, a rectangl with differ side (say length of metr and width of metres) would have an area in squar unit that can be calcul as: metr \u00d7 metr = this is equival to million squar millimetres. other use convers are: squar kilometr = squar metr squar metr = squar centimetr = squar millimetr squar centimetr = squar millimetres. ==== non-metr unit ==== in non-metr units, the convers between two squar unit is the squar of the convers between the correspond length units. foot = inches,th relationship between squar feet and squar inch is squar foot = squar inches,wher = = \u00d7 similarly: squar yard = squar feet squar mile = squar yard = squar feetin addition, convers factor include: squar inch = squar centimetr squar foot = squar metr squar yard = squar metr squar mile = squar kilometr === other unit includ histor === there are sever other common unit for area. the are was the origin unit of area in the metric system, with: are = squar metresthough the are has fallen out of use, the hectar is still common use to measur land: hectar = are = squar metr = squar kilometresoth uncommon metric unit of area includ the tetrad, the hectad, and the myriad. the acr is also common use to measur land areas, where acr = squar yard = squar feet.an acr is approxim of a hectare. on the atom scale, area is measur in unit of barns, such that: barn = squar meters.th barn is common use in describ the cross-sect area of interact in nuclear physics.in india, dhurki = dhur dhur = khatha khata = bigha khata = acr == histori == === circl area === in the centuri bce, hippocr of chio was the first to show that the area of a disk (the region enclos by a circle) is proport to the squar of it diameter, as part of his quadratur of the lune of hippocrates, but did not identifi the constant of proportionality. eudoxus of cnidus, also in the centuri bce, also found that the area of a disk is proport to it radius squared.subsequently, book i of euclid element dealt with equal of area between two-dimension figures. the mathematician archimed use the tool of euclidean geometri to show that the area insid a circl is equal to that of a right triangl whose base has the length of the circl circumfer and whose height equal the circl radius, in his book measur of a circle. (the circumfer is and the area of a triangl is half the base time the height, yield the area for the disk.) archimed approxim the valu of \u03c0 (and henc the area of a unit-radius circle) with his doubl method, in which he inscrib a regular triangl in a circl and note it area, then doubl the number of side to give a regular hexagon, then repeat doubl the number of side as the polygon area got closer and closer to that of the circl (and did the same with circumscrib polygons). swiss scientist johann heinrich lambert in prove that \u03c0, the ratio of a circl area to it squar radius, is irrational, mean it is not equal to the quotient of ani two whole numbers. in french mathematician adrien-mari legendr prove that is irrational; this also prove that \u03c0 is irrational. in german mathematician ferdinand von lindemann prove that \u03c0 is transcendent (not the solut of ani polynomi equat with ration coefficients), confirm a conjectur made by both legendr and euler. === triangl area === heron (or hero) of alexandria found what is known as heron formula for the area of a triangl in term of it sides, and a proof can be found in his book, metrica, written around ce. it has been suggest that archimed knew the formula over two centuri earlier, and sinc metrica is a collect of the mathemat knowledg avail in the ancient world, it is possibl that the formula predat the refer given in that work.in aryabhata, a great mathematician-astronom from the classic age of indian mathemat and indian astronomy, express the area of a triangl as one-half the base time the height in the aryabhatiya (section a formula equival to heron was discov by the chines independ of the greeks. it was publish in in shushu jiuzhang (\"mathemat treatis in nine sections\"), written by qin jiushao. === quadrilater area === in the centuri ce, brahmagupta develop a formula, now known as brahmagupta formula, for the area of a cyclic quadrilater (a quadrilater inscrib in a circle) in term of it sides. in the german mathematician carl anton bretschneid and karl georg christian von staudt independ found a formula, known as bretschneid formula, for the area of ani quadrilateral. === general polygon area === the develop of cartesian coordin by ren\u00e9 descart in the centuri allow the develop of the surveyor formula for the area of ani polygon with known vertex locat by gauss in the century. === area determin use calculus === the develop of integr calculus in the late centuri provid tool that could subsequ be use for comput more complic areas, such as the area of an ellips and the surfac area of various curv three-dimension objects. == area formula == === polygon formula === for a non-self-intersect (simple) polygon, the cartesian coordin ( x i , y i ) {\\displaystyl (x_{i},y_{i})} ..., of whose n vertic are known, the area is given by the surveyor formula: a = | \u2211 i = n \u2212 ( x i y i + \u2212 x i + y i ) | {\\displaystyl a={\\frac \\vert }\\sum \\vert }} where when then is express as modulus n and so refer to ==== rectangl ==== the most basic area formula is the formula for the area of a rectangle. given a rectangl with length l and width w, the formula for the area is: a = lw (rectangle).that is, the area of the rectangl is the length multipli by the width. as a special case, as l = w in the case of a square, the area of a squar with side length s is given by the formula: a = (square).th formula for the area of a rectangl follow direct from the basic properti of area, and is sometim taken as a definit or axiom. on the other hand, if geometri is develop befor arithmetic, this formula can be use to defin multipl of real numbers. ==== dissection, parallelograms, and triangl ==== most other simpl formula for area follow from the method of dissection. this involv cut a shape into pieces, whose area must sum to the area of the origin shape. for an example, ani parallelogram can be subdivid into a trapezoid and a right triangle, as shown in figur to the left. if the triangl is move to the other side of the trapezoid, then the result figur is a rectangle. it follow that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle: a = bh (parallelogram). however, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a diagon into two congruent triangles, as shown in the figur to the right. it follow that the area of each triangl is half the area of the parallelogram: a = b h {\\displaystyl a={\\frac (triangle).similar argument can be use to find area formula for the trapezoid as well as more complic polygons. === area of curv shape === ==== circl ==== the formula for the area of a circl (more proper call the area enclos by a circl or the area of a disk) is base on a similar method. given a circl of radius r, it is possibl to partit the circl into sectors, as shown in the figur to the right. each sector is approxim triangular in shape, and the sector can be rearrang to form an approxim parallelogram. the height of this parallelogram is r, and the width is half the circumfer of the circle, or \u03c0r. thus, the total area of the circl is a = (circle).though the dissect use in this formula is onli approximate, the error becom smaller and smaller as the circl is partit into more and more sectors. the limit of the area of the approxim parallelogram is exact which is the area of the circle.thi argument is actual a simpl applic of the idea of calculus. in ancient times, the method of exhaust was use in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recogn as a precursor to integr calculus. use modern methods, the area of a circl can be comput use a definit integral: a = \u222b \u2212 r r r \u2212 x d x = \u03c0 r . {\\displaystyl _{-r}^{r}{\\sqrt ==== ellips ==== the formula for the area enclos by an ellips is relat to the formula of a circle; for an ellips with semi-major and semi-minor axe x and y the formula is: a = \u03c0 x y . {\\displaystyl a=\\pi xy.} ==== surfac area ==== most basic formula for surfac area can be obtain by cut surfac and flatten them out. for example, if the side surfac of a cylind (or ani prism) is cut lengthwise, the surfac can be flatten out into a rectangle. similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a cone, the side surfac can be flatten out into a sector of a circle, and the result area computed. the formula for the surfac area of a sphere is more difficult to derive: becaus a sphere has nonzero gaussian curvature, it cannot be flatten out. the formula for the surfac area of a sphere was first obtain by archimed in his work on the sphere and cylinder. the formula is: a = (sphere),wher r is the radius of the sphere. as with the formula for the area of a circle, ani deriv of this formula inher use method similar to calculus. === general formula === ==== area of figur ==== a triangle: b h {\\displaystyl {\\tfrac (where b is ani side, and h is the distanc from the line on which b lie to the other vertex of the triangle). this formula can be use if the height h is known. if the length of the three side are known then heron formula can be used: s ( s \u2212 a ) ( s \u2212 b ) ( s \u2212 c ) {\\displaystyl {\\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}} where a, b, c are the side of the triangle, and s = ( a + b + c ) {\\displaystyl s={\\tfrac is half of it perimeter. if an angl and it two includ side are given, the area is a b sin \u2061 ( c ) {\\displaystyl {\\tfrac where c is the given angl and a and b are it includ sides. if the triangl is graph on a coordin plane, a matrix can be use and is simplifi to the absolut valu of ( x y + x y + x y \u2212 x y \u2212 x y \u2212 x y ) {\\displaystyl {\\tfrac . this formula is also known as the shoelac formula and is an easi way to solv for the area of a coordin triangl by substitut the point and the shoelac formula can also be use to find the area of other polygon when their vertic are known. anoth approach for a coordin triangl is to use calculus to find the area. a simpl polygon construct on a grid of equal-distanc point (i.e., point with integ coordinates) such that all the polygon vertic are grid points: i + b \u2212 {\\displaystyl i+{\\frac , where i is the number of grid point insid the polygon and b is the number of boundari points. this result is known as pick theorem. ==== area in calculus ==== the area between a positive-valu curv and the horizont axis, measur between two valu a and b (b is defin as the larger of the two values) on the horizont axis, is given by the integr from a to b of the function that repres the curve: a = \u222b a b f ( x ) d x . {\\displaystyl a=\\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.} the area between the graph of two function is equal to the integr of one function, f(x), minus the integr of the other function, g(x): a = \u222b a b ( f ( x ) \u2212 g ( x ) ) d x , {\\displaystyl a=\\int _{a}^{b}(f(x)-g(x))\\,dx,} where f ( x ) {\\displaystyl f(x)} is the curv with the greater y-value.an area bound by a function r = r ( \u03b8 ) {\\displaystyl r=r(\\theta )} express in polar coordin is: a = \u222b r d \u03b8 . {\\displaystyl \\over .} the area enclos by a parametr curv u \u2192 ( t ) = ( x ( t ) , y ( t ) ) {\\displaystyl {\\vec {u}}(t)=(x(t),y(t))} with endpoint u \u2192 ( t ) = u \u2192 ( t ) {\\displaystyl {\\vec is given by the line integrals: \u222e t t x y \u02d9 d t = \u2212 \u222e t t y x \u02d9 d t = \u222e t t ( x y \u02d9 \u2212 y x \u02d9 ) d t {\\displaystyl \\oint {y}}\\,dt=-\\oint \\over {y}}-y{\\dot {x}})\\,dt} or the z-compon of \u222e t t u \u2192 \u00d7 u \u2192 \u02d9 d t . {\\displaystyl \\over {u}}\\tim {\\dot {\\vec {u}}}\\,dt.} (for details, see green theorem \u00a7 area calculation.) this is the principl of the planimet mechan device. ==== bound area between two quadrat function ==== to find the bound area between two quadrat functions, we subtract one from the other to write the differ as f ( x ) \u2212 g ( x ) = a x + b x + c = a ( x \u2212 \u03b1 ) ( x \u2212 \u03b2 ) {\\displaystyl )(x-\\beta )} where f(x) is the quadrat upper bound and g(x) is the quadrat lower bound. defin the discrimin of f(x)-g(x) as \u03b4 = b \u2212 a c . {\\displaystyl \\delta by simplifi the integr formula between the graph of two function (as given in the section above) and use vieta formula, we can obtain a = \u03b4 \u03b4 a = a ( \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1 ) , a \u2260 {\\displaystyl a={\\frac {\\delta {\\sqrt {\\delta -\\alpha a\\neq the abov remain valid if one of the bound function is linear instead of quadratic. ==== surfac area of figur ==== cone: \u03c0 r ( r + r + h ) {\\displaystyl \\pi r\\left(r+{\\sqrt , where r is the radius of the circular base, and h is the height. that can also be rewritten as \u03c0 r + \u03c0 r l {\\displaystyl \\pi rl} or \u03c0 r ( r + l ) {\\displaystyl \\pi r(r+l)\\,\\!} where r is the radius and l is the slant height of the cone. \u03c0 r {\\displaystyl \\pi is the base area while \u03c0 r l {\\displaystyl \\pi rl}

height. the \u03c0 {\\displaystyl \\pi } r can also be rewritten as \u03c0 {\\displaystyl \\pi } d, where d is the diameter. prism: + ph, where b is the area of a base, p is the perimet of a base, and h is the height of the prism. pyramid: b + p l {\\displaystyl b+{\\frac , where b is the area of the base, p is the perimet of the base, and l is the length of the slant. rectangular prism: ( \u2113 w + \u2113 h + w h ) {\\displaystyl w+\\ell h+wh)} , where \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\ell } is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. ==== general formula for surfac area ==== the general formula for the surfac area of the graph of a continu differenti function z = f ( x , y ) , {\\displaystyl z=f(x,y),} where ( x , y ) \u2208 d \u2282 r {\\displaystyl (x,y)\\in d\\subset \\mathbb {r} and d {\\displaystyl d} is a region in the xy-plan with the smooth boundary: a = \u222c d ( \u2202 f \u2202 x ) + ( \u2202 f \u2202 y ) + d x d y . {\\displaystyl a=\\iint _{d}{\\sqrt {\\left({\\frac

v}}\\right|\\,du\\,dv.} === list of formula === the abov calcul show how to find the area of mani common shapes. the area of irregular polygon can be calcul use the \"surveyor formula\". === relat of area to perimet === the isoperimetr inequ state that, for a close curv of length l (so the region it enclos has perimet l) and for area a of the region that it encloses, \u03c0 a \u2264 l , {\\displaystyl a\\leq and equal hold if and onli if the curv is a circle. thus a circl has the largest area of ani close figur with a given perimeter. at the other extreme, a figur with given perimet l could have an arbitrarili small area, as illustr by a rhombus that is \"tip over\" arbitrarili far so that two of it angl are arbitrarili close to and the other two are arbitrarili close to for a circle, the ratio of the area to the circumfer (the term for the perimet of a circle) equal half the radius r. this can be seen from the area formula and the circumfer formula the area of a regular polygon is half it perimet time the apothem (where the apothem is the distanc from the center to the nearest point on ani side). === fractal === doubl the edg length of a polygon multipli it area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) rais to the power of two (the dimens of the space the polygon resid in). but if the one-dimension length of a fractal drawn in two dimens are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scale by a power of two that is not necessarili an integer. this power is call the fractal dimens of the fractal. == area bisector == there are an infinitud of line that bisect the area of a triangle. three of them are the median of the triangl (which connect the side midpoint with the opposit vertices), and these are concurr at the triangl centroid; indeed, they are the onli area bisector that go through the centroid. ani line through a triangl that split both the triangl area and it perimet in half goe through the triangl incent (the center of it incircle). there are either one, two, or three of these for ani given triangle. ani line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisect the area. all area bisector of a circl or other ellips go through the center, and ani chord through the center bisect the area. in the case of a circl they are the diamet of the circle. == optim == given a wire contour, the surfac of least area span (\"filling\") it is a minim surface. familiar exampl includ soap bubbles. the question of the fill area of the riemannian circl remain open.th circl has the largest area of ani two-dimension object have the same perimeter. a cyclic polygon (one inscrib in a circle) has the largest area of ani polygon with a given number of side of the same lengths. a version of the isoperimetr inequ for triangl state that the triangl of greatest area among all those with a given perimet is equilateral.th triangl of largest area of all those inscrib in a given circl is equilateral; and the triangl of smallest area of all those circumscrib around a given circl is equilateral.th ratio of the area of the incircl to the area of an equilater triangle, \u03c0 {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\pi , is larger

    "the fahrenheit scale or is a temperatur scale base on one propos in by the physicist daniel gabriel fahrenheit it use the degre fahrenheit symbol f as the unit sever account of how he origin defin his scale exist but the origin paper suggest the lower defin point f was establish as the freez temperatur of a solut of brine made from a mixtur of water ice and ammonium chlorid a salt the other limit establish was his best estim of the averag human bodi temperatur origin set at f then f about f less than the modern valu due to a later redefinit of the scale howev he note a middl point of f to be set to the temperatur of ice water. the fahrenheit scale is now usual defin by two fix points: the temperatur at which pure water ice melt is defin as \u00b0f and the boil point of water is defin to be \u00b0f, both at sea level and under standard atmospher pressur (a \u00b0f separation). in the first decad of the centuri in the dutch republic, fahrenheit made two revolutionari breakthrough in the histori of thermometry. he invent the mercury-in-glass thermomet (first wide used, accurate, practic thermometer) and fahrenheit scale. fahrenheit was the first standard temperatur scale to be wide used, although it use is now limited. it is the offici temperatur scale in the unit state (includ it unincorpor territories), it freeli associ state in the western pacif (palau, the feder state of micronesia and the marshal islands), the cayman islands, and liberia. fahrenheit is use alongsid the celsius scale in antigua and barbuda and other countri which use the same meteorolog service, such as saint kitt and nevis, the bahamas, and belize. a hand of british oversea territori still use both scales, includ the british virgin islands, montserrat, anguilla, and bermuda. in newspap in the unit kingdom, degre fahrenheit figur are sometim use in headlin for the sensat of heatwaves. all other countri in the world now offici use the celsius scale, the name given to the centigrad scale in in honor of swedish astronom ander celsius. == definit and convers == on the fahrenheit scale, the melt point of water is and the boil point is (at standard atmospher pressure). this put the boil and freez point of water degre apart. therefore, a degre on the fahrenheit scale is of the interv between the freez point and the boil point. on the celsius scale, the freez and boil point of water are degre apart. a temperatur interv of \u00b0f is equal to an interv of degre celsius. the fahrenheit and celsius scale intersect at (i.e., \u00b0f = \u00b0c). absolut zero is \u00b0c or \u00b0f. the rankin temperatur scale use degre interv of the same size as those of the fahrenheit scale, except that absolut zero is \u00b0r \u2014 the same way that the kelvin temperatur scale match the celsius scale, except that absolut zero is k.the combin of degre symbol \u00b0 follow by an uppercas letter f is the convent symbol for the fahrenheit temperatur scale. a number follow by this symbol (and separ from it with a space) denot a specif temperatur point (e.g. \"gallium melt at \u00b0f\"), a differ between temperatur (e.g. \"the output of the heat exchang experi an increas of \u00b0f\") or an uncertainti in temperatur (e.g. \"our standard uncertainti is \u00b0f\"). the symbol for the celsius scale also use the degre symbol but with an uppercas letter c (\"\u00b0c\"), while the symbol for the kelvin scale is just an uppercas letter k (\"k\"). the numer valu of a temperatur differ or temperatur interv is the same when express in either degre celsius or in kelvin. === convers (specif temperatur point) === for an exact convers between fahrenheit and celsius of a specif temperatur point, the follow formula can be applied. here, f is the valu in fahrenheit and c the valu in celsius: f \u00b0fahrenheit to c \u00b0celsius: (f \u2212 \u00b0f \u00d7 = (f \u2212 \u00b0c = c \u00b0c c \u00b0celsius to f \u00b0fahrenheit: (c \u00b0c \u00d7 + \u00b0f = (c \u00d7 \u00b0f + \u00b0f = f \u00b0fthere is also an exact convers make use of the equal \u00b0f = \u00b0c. again, f is the valu in fahrenheit and c the valu in celsius: f \u00b0fahrenheit to c \u00b0celsius : ((f + \u00f7 \u2212 = c. c \u00b0celsius to f \u00b0fahrenheit : ((c + \u00d7 \u2212 = f. === convers (temperatur differ or interval) === when convert a temperatur interv between \u00b0f and \u00b0c, onli the ratio is used, without ani constant (in this case, the interv has the same numer valu in kelvin as in degre celsius): f \u00b0fahrenheit to c \u00b0celsius or kelvin: f \u00b0f \u00d7 = \u00b0c = c \u00b0c = c k c \u00b0celsius to f \u00b0fahrenheit: c \u00b0c \u00d7 \u00b0f = (c \u00d7 \u00b0f = f \u00b0f == histori == fahrenheit propos his temperatur scale in base it on two refer point of temperature. in his initi scale (which is not the final fahrenheit scale), the zero point was determin by place the thermomet in \"a mixtur of ice, water, and sali armoniaci [transl. ammonium chloride] or even sea salt\". this combin form a eutect system which stabil it temperatur automatically: \u00b0f was defin to be that stabl temperature. a second point, degrees, was approxim the human bodi temperatur (sanguin homini sani, the blood of a healthi person). a third point, degrees, was mark as be the temperatur of ice and water \"without the aforement salts\".accord to a german story, fahrenheit actual chose the lowest air temperatur measur in his hometown danzig (gda\u0144sk, poland) in winter as \u00b0f, and onli later had the need to be abl to make this valu reproduc use brine.accord to a letter fahrenheit wrote to his friend herman boerhaave, his scale was built on the work of ole r\u00f8mer, whom he had met earlier. in r\u00f8mer scale, brine freez at zero, water freez and melt at degrees, bodi temperatur is and water boil at degrees. fahrenheit multipli each valu by four in order to elimin fraction and make the scale more fine-grained. he then re-calibr his scale use the melt point of ice and normal human bodi temperatur (which were at and degrees); he adjust the scale so that the melt point of ice would be degre and bodi temperatur degrees, so that interv would separ the two, allow him to mark degre line on his instrument by simpli bisect the interv six time (sinc is to the sixth power).fahrenheit soon after observ that water boil at about degre use this scale. the use of the freez and boil point of water as thermomet fix refer point becam popular follow the work of ander celsius and these fix point were adopt by a committe of the royal societi led by henri cavendish in under this system, the fahrenheit scale is redefin slight so that the freez point of water is exact \u00b0f, and the boil point is exact \u00b0f or degre higher. it is for this reason that normal human bodi temperatur is approxim (oral temperature) on the revis scale (wherea it was on fahrenheit multipl of r\u00f8mer, and on his origin scale).in the present-day fahrenheit scale, \u00b0f no longer correspond to the eutect temperatur of ammonium chlorid brine as describ above. instead, that eutect is at approxim \u00b0f on the final fahrenheit scale.th rankin temperatur scale was base upon the fahrenheit temperatur scale, with it zero repres absolut zero instead. == usag == the fahrenheit scale was the primari temperatur standard for climatic, industri and medic purpos in english-speak countri until the in the late and the celsius scale replac fahrenheit in almost all of those countries\u2014with the notabl except of the unit state and in certain cases, the unit kingdom\u2014typ dure their general metric process. fahrenheit is use in the unit states, it territori and associ state (all serv by the u.s. nation weather service), as well as the cayman island and liberia for everyday applications. for example, u.s. weather forecasts, food cooking, and freez temperatur are typic given in degre fahrenheit. scientists, such as meteorologists, use degre celsius or kelvin in all countries.ear in the century, halsey and dale suggest that reason for resist to use the centigrad (now celsius) system in the u.s. includ the larger size of each degre celsius and the lower zero point in the fahrenheit system.canada has pass legisl favor the intern system of units, while also maintain legal definit for tradit canadian imperi units. canadian weather report are convey use degre celsius with occasion refer to fahrenheit especi for cross-bord broadcasts. fahrenheit is still use on virtual all canadian ovens. thermometers, both digit and analog, sold in canada usual employ both the celsius and fahrenheit scales. in the european union, it is mandatori to use kelvin or degre celsius when quot temperatur for \"economic, public health, public safeti and administrative\" purposes, though degre fahrenheit may be use alongsid degre celsius as a supplementari unit. for example, the laundri symbol use in the unit kingdom follow the recommend of iso show the temperatur of the wash machin water in degre celsius only. the equival label in north america use one to six dot to denot temperatur with an option temperatur in degre celsius.fahrenheit is still common use in the unit kingdom in common conversation, but less so with young peopl and mani peopl use both depend on the context. within unregul sectors, such as journalism, the use of fahrenheit in the unit kingdom follow no fix pattern with degre fahrenheit often appear alongsid degre celsius. the daili telegraph doe not mention fahrenheit on it daili weather page while the time also has an all-metr daili weather page but has a celsius-to-fahrenheit convers table. when publish news stories, much of the uk press have adopt a tendenc of use degre celsius in headlin and discuss relat to low temperatur and fahrenheit for mid to high temperatures. in februari the writer of an articl in the time suggest that the rational was one of emphasis: \u00b0c\" sound colder than \u00b0f\" and

    "the densiti more precis the volumetr mass densiti also known as specif mass of a substanc is it mass per unit volum the symbol most often use for densiti is \u03c1 the lower case greek letter rho although the latin letter d can also be use mathemat densiti is defin as mass divid by volum \u03c1 m v displaystyl rho frac m v where \u03c1 is the densiti m is the mass and v is the volum in some case for instanc in the unit state oil and gas industri densiti is loos defin as it weight per unit volume, although this is scientif inaccur \u2013 this quantiti is more specif call specif weight. for a pure substanc the densiti has the same numer valu as it mass concentration. differ materi usual have differ densities, and densiti may be relev to buoyancy, puriti and packaging. osmium and iridium are the densest known element at standard condit for temperatur and pressure. to simplifi comparison of densiti across differ system of units, it is sometim replac by the dimensionless quantiti \"relat density\" or \"specif gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the densiti of the materi to that of a standard material, usual water. thus a relat densiti less than one relat to water mean that the substanc float in water. the densiti of a materi vari with temperatur and pressure. this variat is typic small for solid and liquid but much greater for gases. increas the pressur on an object decreas the volum of the object and thus increas it density. increas the temperatur of a substanc (with a few exceptions) decreas it densiti by increas it volume. in most materials, heat the bottom of a fluid result in convect of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decreas in the densiti of the heat fluid. this caus it to rise relat to more dens unheat material. the reciproc of the densiti of a substanc is occasion call it specif volume, a term sometim use in thermodynamics. densiti is an intens properti in that increas the amount of a substanc doe not increas it density; rather it increas it mass. == histori == in a well-known but probabl apocryph tale, archimed was given the task of determin whether king hiero goldsmith was embezzl gold dure the manufactur of a golden wreath dedic to the god and replac it with another, cheaper alloy. archimed knew that the irregular shape wreath could be crush into a cube whose volum could be calcul easili and compar with the mass; but the king did not approv of this. baffled, archimed is said to have taken an immers bath and observ from the rise of the water upon enter that he could calcul the volum of the gold wreath through the displac of the water. upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran nake through the street shouting, \"eureka! eureka!\" (\u03b5\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1! greek \"i have found it\"). as a result, the term \"eureka\" enter common parlanc and is use today to indic a moment of enlightenment. the stori first appear in written form in vitruvius book of architecture, two centuri after it suppos took place. some scholar have doubt the accuraci of this tale, say among other thing that the method would have requir precis measur that would have been difficult to make at the time.from the equat for densiti (\u03c1 = m/v), mass densiti has unit of mass divid by volume. as there are mani unit of mass and volum cover mani differ magnitud there are a larg number of unit for mass densiti in use. the si unit of kilogram per cubic metr and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimetr are probabl the most common use unit for density. one is equal to one cubic centimetr (abbrevi cc) is equal to one millilitre. in industry, other larger or smaller unit of mass and or volum are often more practic and us customari unit may be used. see below for a list of some of the most common unit of density. == measur of densiti == a number of techniqu as well as standard exist for the measur of densiti of materials. such techniqu includ the use of a hydromet (a buoyanc method for liquids), hydrostat balanc (a buoyanc method for liquid and solids), immers bodi method (a buoyanc method for liquids), pycnomet (liquid and solids), air comparison pycnomet (solids), oscil densitomet (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids). however, each individu method or techniqu measur differ type of densiti (e.g. bulk density, skelet density, etc.), and therefor it is necessari to have an understand of the type of densiti be measur as well as the type of materi in question. === homogen materi === the densiti at all point of a homogen object equal it total mass divid by it total volume. the mass is normal measur with a scale or balance; the volum may be measur direct (from the geometri of the object) or by the displac of a fluid. to determin the densiti of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymet or a corioli flow meter may be used, respectively. similarly, hydrostat weigh use the displac of water due to a submerg object to determin the densiti of the object. === heterogen materi === if the bodi is not homogeneous, then it densiti vari between differ region of the object. in that case the densiti around ani given locat is determin by calcul the densiti of a small volum around that location. in the limit of an infinitesim volum the densiti of an inhomogen object at a point becomes: \u03c1 ( r \u2192 ) = d m / d v {\\displaystyl \\rho ({\\vec {r}})=dm/dv} , where d v {\\displaystyl dv} is an elementari volum at posit r {\\displaystyl r} . the mass of the bodi then can be express as m = \u222b v \u03c1 ( r \u2192 ) d v . {\\displaystyl m=\\int _{v}\\rho ({\\vec {r}})\\,dv.} === non-compact materi === in practice, bulk materi such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. mani materi exist in natur as flakes, pellets, or granules. void are region which contain someth other than the consid material. common the void is air, but it could also be vacuum, liquid, solid, or a differ gas or gaseous mixture. the bulk volum of a material\u2014inclus of the void fraction\u2014i often obtain by a simpl measur (e.g. with a calibr measur cup) or geometr from known dimensions. mass divid by bulk volum determin bulk density. this is not the same thing as volumetr mass density. to determin volumetr mass density, one must first discount the volum of the void fraction. sometim this can be determin by geometr reasoning. for the close-pack of equal sphere the non-void fraction can be at most about it can also be determin empirically. some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a variabl void fraction which depend on how the materi is agit or poured. it might be loos or compact, with more or less air space depend on handling. in practice, the void fraction is not necessarili air, or even gaseous. in the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantag for measur as the void fraction for sand satur in water\u2014onc ani air bubbl are thorough driven out\u2014i potenti more consist than dri sand measur with an air void. in the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determin the mass of the materi sample. if the materi is under pressur (common ambient air pressur at the earth surface) the determin of mass from a measur sampl weight might need to account for buoyanc effect due to the densiti of the void constituent, depend on how the measur was conducted. in the case of dri sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyanc effect is common neglect (less than one part in one thousand). mass chang upon displac one void materi with anoth while maintain constant volum can be use to estim the void fraction, if the differ in densiti of the two void materi is reliabl known. == chang of densiti == in general, densiti can be chang by chang either the pressur or the temperature. increas the pressur alway increas the densiti of a material. increas the temperatur general decreas the density, but there are notabl except to this generalization. for example, the densiti of water increas between it melt point at \u00b0c and \u00b0c; similar behavior is observ in silicon at low temperatures. the effect of pressur and temperatur on the densiti of liquid and solid is small. the compress for a typic liquid or solid is bar = mpa) and a typic thermal expans is this rough translat into need around ten thousand time atmospher pressur to reduc the volum of a substanc by one percent. (although the pressur need may be around a thousand time smaller for sandi soil and some clays.) a one percent expans of volum typic requir a temperatur increas on the order of thousand of degre celsius. in contrast, the densiti of gase is strong affect by pressure. the densiti of an ideal gas is \u03c1 = m p r t , {\\displaystyl \\rho ={\\frac {mp}{rt}},} where m is the molar mass, p is the pressure, r is the univers gas constant, and t is the absolut temperature. this mean that the densiti of an ideal gas can be doubl by doubl the pressure, or by halv the absolut temperature. in the case of volum thermal expans at constant pressur and small interv of temperatur the temperatur depend of densiti is : \u03c1 = \u03c1 t + \u03b1 \u22c5 \u03b4 t {\\displaystyl \\rho ={\\frac {\\rho \\cdot \\delta t}}} where \u03c1 t {\\displaystyl \\rho is the densiti at a refer temperature, \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } is the thermal expans coeffici of the materi at temperatur close to t {\\displaystyl . == densiti of solut == the densiti of a solut is the sum of mass (massic) concentr of the compon of that solution. mass (massic) concentr of each given compon \u03c1i in a solut sum to densiti of the solution. \u03c1 = \u2211 i \u03f1 i {\\displaystyl \\rho =\\sum _{i}\\varrho _{i}\\,} express as a function of the densiti of pure compon of the mixtur and their volum participation, it allow the determin of excess molar volumes: \u03c1 = \u2211 i \u03c1 i v i v = \u2211 i \u03c1 i \u03c6 i = \u2211 i \u03c1 i v i \u2211 i v i + \u2211 i v e i {\\displaystyl \\rho =\\sum _{i}\\rho _{i}{\\frac {v_{i}}{v}}\\,=\\sum _{i}\\rho _{i}\\varphi _{i}=\\sum _{i}\\rho _{i}{\\frac {v_{i}}{\\sum _{i}v_{i}+\\sum _{i}{v^{e}}_{i}}}} provid that there is no interact between the components. know the relat between excess volum and activ coeffici of the components, one can determin the activ coefficients. v e \u00af i = r t \u2202 ln \u2061 \u03b3 i \u2202 p {\\displaystyl {\\overlin {v^{e}}}_{i}=rt{\\frac {\\partial \\ln \\gamma _{i}}{\\parti p}}} == densiti == === various materi === select chemic element are list here. for the densiti of all chemic elements, see list of chemic element === other === === water === === air === === molar volum of liquid and solid phase of element === == common unit == the si unit for densiti is: kilogram per cubic metr litr and metric ton are not part of the si, but are accept for use with it, lead to the follow units: kilogram per litr (kg/l) gram per millilitr (g/ml) metric ton per cubic metr use the follow metric unit all have exact the same numer value, one thousandth of the valu in liquid water has a densiti of about make ani of these si unit numer conveni to use as most solid and liquid have densiti between and kilogram per cubic decimetr gram per cubic centimetr = megagram (metric ton) per cubic metr us customari unit densiti can be state in: avoirdupoi ounc per cubic inch \u2248 oz/cu in) avoirdupoi ounc per fluid ounc \u2248 oz/us fl oz = lb/us fl pint) avoirdupoi pound per cubic inch \u2248 lb/cu in) pound per cubic foot \u2248 lb/cu ft) pound per cubic yard \u2248 lb/cu yd) pound per us liquid gallon \u2248 lb/us gal) pound per us bushel \u2248 lb/bu) slug per cubic footimperi unit differ from the abov (as the imperi gallon and bushel differ from the us units) in practic are rare used, though found in older documents. the imperi gallon was base on the concept that an imperi fluid ounc of water would have a mass of one avoirdupoi ounce, and inde \u2248 ounc per imperi fluid ounc = pound per imperi gallon. the densiti of precious metal could conceiv be base on troy ounc and pounds, a possibl caus of confusion. know the volum of the unit cell of a crystallin materi and it formula weight (in daltons), the densiti can be calculated. one dalton per cubic \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is equal to a densiti of == see also == == refer == == extern link == \"density\" . encyclop\u00e6dia britannica. ed.). \"density\" . the new student refer work . video: densiti experi with oil and alcohol video: densiti experi with whiskey and water glass densiti calcul \u2013 calcul of the densiti of glass at room temperatur and of glass melt at \u2013 list of element of the period tabl \u2013 sort by densiti calcul of satur liquid densiti for some compon field densiti test water \u2013 densiti and specif weight temperatur depend of the densiti of water \u2013 convers of densiti unit a delici densiti experi water densiti calcul archiv juli at the wayback machin water densiti for a given salin and temperature. liquid densiti calcul select a liquid from the list and calcul densiti as a function of temperature. gas densiti calcul calcul densiti of a gas for as a function of temperatur and pressure. densiti of various materials. determin of densiti of solid, instruct for perform classroom experiment. densiti predict densiti predict",
    "radioact decay also known as nuclear decay radioact radioact disintegr or nuclear disintegr is the process by which an unstabl atom nucleus lose energi by radiat a materi contain unstabl nuclei is consid radioact three of the most common type of decay are alpha decay beta decay and gamma decay all of which involv emit one or more particl or photon the weak forc is the mechan that is respons for beta decay while the other two are govern by the usual electromagnet and strong forc radioact decay is a stochast i e random process at the level of singl atom accord to quantum theori it is imposs to predict when a particular atom will decay regardless of how long the atom has exist howev for a signific number of ident atom the overal decay rate can be express as a decay constant or as half life the half live of radioact atom have a huge rang from near instantan to far longer than the age of the univers the decay nucleus is call the parent radionuclid or parent radioisotop and the process produc at least one daughter nuclid except for gamma decay or intern convers from a nuclear excit state the decay is a nuclear transmut result in a daughter contain a differ number of proton or neutron (or both). when the number of proton changes, an atom of a differ chemic element is created. alpha decay occur when the nucleus eject an alpha particl (helium nucleus). beta decay occur in two ways; (i) beta-minus decay, when the nucleus emit an electron and an antineutrino in a process that chang a neutron to a proton. (ii) beta-plus decay, when the nucleus emit a positron and a neutrino in a process that chang a proton to a neutron, this process is also known as positron emission. in gamma decay a radioact nucleus first decay by the emiss of an alpha or beta particle. the daughter nucleus that result is usual left in an excit state and it can decay to a lower energi state by emit a gamma ray photon. in neutron emission, extrem neutron-rich nuclei, form due to other type of decay or after mani success neutron captures, occasion lose energi by way of neutron emission, result in a chang from one isotop to anoth of the same element. in electron capture, the nucleus may captur an orbit electron, caus a proton to convert into a neutron in a process call electron capture. a neutrino and a gamma ray are subsequ emitted. in cluster decay and nuclear fission, a nucleus heavier than an alpha particl is emitted.bi contrast, there are radioact decay process that do not result in a nuclear transmutation. the energi of an excit nucleus may be emit as a gamma ray in a process call gamma decay, or that energi may be lost when the nucleus interact with an orbit electron caus it eject from the atom, in a process call intern conversion. anoth type of radioact decay result in product that vary, appear as two or more \"fragments\" of the origin nucleus with a rang of possibl masses. this decay, call spontan fission, happen when a larg unstabl nucleus spontan split into two (or occasion three) smaller daughter nuclei, and general lead to the emiss of gamma rays, neutrons, or other particl from those products. in contrast, decay product from a nucleus with spin may be distribut non-isotrop with respect to that spin direction. either becaus of an extern influenc such as an electromagnet field, or becaus the nucleus was produc in a dynam process that constrain the direct of it spin, the anisotropi may be detectable. such a parent process could be a previous decay, or a nuclear reaction.for a summari tabl show the number of stabl and radioact nuclid in each category, see radionuclide. there are natur occur chemic element on earth that are radioactive, consist of radionuclid element have differ radionuclides) that date befor the time of format of the solar system. these are known as primordi nuclides. well-known exampl are uranium and thorium, but also includ are natur occur long-liv radioisotopes, such as anoth or so shorter-liv radionuclides, such as and found on earth, are the product of decay chain that began with the primordi nuclides, or are the product of ongo cosmogen processes, such as the product of from in the atmospher by cosmic rays. radionuclid may also be produc artifici in particl acceler or nuclear reactors, result in of these with half-liv of over an hour, and sever thousand more with even shorter half-lives. (see list of nuclid for a list of these sort by half-life.) == histori of discoveri == radioact was discov in by the french scientist henri becquerel, while work with phosphoresc materials. these materi glow in the dark after exposur to light, and he suspect that the glow produc in cathod ray tube by x-ray might be associ with phosphorescence. he wrap a photograph plate in black paper and place various phosphoresc salt on it. all result were negat until he use uranium salts. the uranium salt caus a blacken of the plate in spite of the plate be wrap in black paper. these radiat were given the name \"becquerel rays\". it soon becam clear that the blacken of the plate had noth to do with phosphorescence, as the blacken was also produc by non-phosphoresc salt of uranium and by metal uranium. it becam clear from these experi that there was a form of invis radiat that could pass through paper and was caus the plate to react as if expos to light. at first, it seem as though the new radiat was similar to the then recent discov x-rays. further research by becquerel, ernest rutherford, paul villard, pierr curie, mari curie, and other show that this form of radioact was signific more complicated. rutherford was the first to realiz that all such element decay in accord with the same mathemat exponenti formula. rutherford and his student frederick soddi were the first to realiz that mani decay process result in the transmut of one element to another. subsequently, the radioact displac law of fajan and soddi was formul to describ the product of alpha and beta decay.th earli research also discov that mani other chemic elements, besid uranium, have radioact isotopes. a systemat search for the total radioact in uranium ore also guid pierr and mari curi to isol two new elements: polonium and radium. except for the radioact of radium, the chemic similar of radium to barium made these two element difficult to distinguish. mari and pierr curi studi of radioact is an import factor in scienc and medicine. after their research on becquerel ray led them to the discoveri of both radium and polonium, they coin the term \"radioactivity\" to defin the emiss of ioniz radiat by some heavi elements. (later the term was general to all elements.) their research on the penetr ray in uranium and the discoveri of radium launch an era of use radium for the treatment of cancer. their explor of radium could be seen as the first peac use of nuclear energi and the start of modern nuclear medicine. == earli health danger == the danger of ioniz radiat due to radioact and x-ray were not immedi recognized. === x-ray === the discoveri of x\u2011ray by wilhelm r\u00f6ntgen in led to widespread experiment by scientists, physicians, and inventors. mani peopl began recount stori of burns, hair loss and wors in technic journal as earli as in februari of that year, professor daniel and dr. dudley of vanderbilt univers perform an experi involv x-ray dudley head that result in his hair loss. a report by dr. h.d. hawks, of his suffer sever hand and chest burn in an x-ray demonstration, was the first of mani other report in electr review.oth experimenters, includ elihu thomson and nikola tesla, also report burns. thomson deliber expos a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and suffer pain, swelling, and blistering. other effects, includ ultraviolet ray and ozone, were sometim blame for the damage, and mani physician still claim that there were no effect from x-ray exposur at all.despit this, there were some earli systemat hazard investigations, and as earli as william herbert rollin wrote almost despair that his warn about the danger involv in the careless use of x-ray were not be heeded, either by industri or by his colleagues. by this time, rollin had prove that x-ray could kill experiment animals, could caus a pregnant guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a foetus. he also stress that \"anim vari in suscept to the extern action of x-light\" and warn that these differ be consid when patient were treat by mean of x-rays. === radioact substanc === however, the biolog effect of radiat due to radioact substanc were less easi to gauge. this gave the opportun for mani physician and corpor to market radioact substanc as patent medicines. exampl were radium enema treatments, and radium-contain water to be drunk as tonics. mari curi protest against this sort of treatment, warn that the effect of radiat on the human bodi were not well understood. curi later die from aplast anaemia, like caus by exposur to ioniz radiation. by the after a number of case of bone necrosi and death of radium treatment enthusiasts, radium-contain medicin product had been larg remov from the market (radioact quackery). === radiat protect === onli a year after r\u00f6ntgen discoveri of x rays, the american engin wolfram fuch gave what is probabl the first protect advice, but it was not until that the first intern congress of radiolog (icr) was held and consid establish intern protect standards. the effect of radiat on genes, includ the effect of cancer risk, were recogn much later. in hermann joseph muller publish research show genet effect and, in was award the nobel prize in physiolog or medicin for his findings. the second icr was held in stockholm in and propos the adopt of the r\u00f6ntgen unit, and the intern x-ray and radium protect committe (ixrpc) was formed. rolf sievert was name chairman, but a drive forc was georg kay of the british nation physic laboratory. the committe met in and after world war ii, the increas rang and quantiti of radioact substanc be handl as a result of militari and civil nuclear program led to larg group of occup worker and the public be potenti expos to harm level of ionis radiation. this was consid at the first post-war icr conven in london in when the present intern commiss on radiolog protect (icrp) was born. sinc then the icrp has develop the present intern system of radiat protection, cover all aspect of radiat hazard. == unit == the intern system of unit (si) unit of radioact activ is the becquerel (bq), name in honor of the scientist henri becquerel. one bq is defin as one transform (or decay or disintegration) per second. an older unit of radioact is the curie, ci, which was origin defin as \"the quantiti or mass of radium eman in equilibrium with one gram of radium (element)\". today, the curi is defin as disintegr per second, so that curi (ci) = bq. for radiolog protect purposes, although the unit state nuclear regulatori commiss permit the use of the unit curi alongsid si units, the european union european unit of measur direct requir that it use for \"public health ... purposes\" be phase out by decemb effect of ioniz radiat are often measur in unit of gray for mechan or sievert for damag to tissue. == type == earli research found that an electr or magnet field could split radioact emiss into three type of beams. the ray were given the name alpha, beta, and gamma, in increas order of their abil to penetr matter. alpha decay is observ onli in heavier element of atom number (tellurium) and greater, with the except of (which decay to two alpha particles). the other two type of decay are observ in all the elements. lead, atom number is the heaviest element to have ani isotop stabl (to the limit of measurement) to radioact decay. radioact decay is seen in all isotop of all element of atom number (bismuth) or greater. however, is onli veri slight radioactive, with a half-lif greater than the age of the universe; radioisotop with extrem long half-liv are consid effect stabl for practic purposes. in analys the natur of the decay products, it was obvious from the direct of the electromagnet forc appli to the radiat by extern magnet and electr field that alpha particl carri a posit charge, beta particl carri a negat charge, and gamma ray were neutral. from the magnitud of deflection, it was clear that alpha particl were much more massiv than beta particles. pass alpha particl through a veri thin glass window and trap them in a discharg tube allow research to studi the emiss spectrum of the captur particles, and ultim prove that alpha particl are helium nuclei. other experi show beta radiation, result from decay and cathod rays, were high-spe electrons. likewise, gamma radiat and x-ray were found to be high-energi electromagnet radiation. the relationship between the type of decay also began to be examined: for example, gamma decay was almost alway found to be associ with other type of decay, and occur at about the same time, or afterwards. gamma decay as a separ phenomenon, with it own half-lif (now term isomer transition), was found in natur radioact to be a result of the gamma decay of excit metast nuclear isomers, which were in turn creat from other type of decay. although alpha, beta, and gamma radiat were most common found, other type of emiss were eventu discovered. short after the discoveri of the positron in cosmic ray products, it was realiz that the same process that oper in classic beta decay can also produc positron (positron emission), along with neutrino (classic beta decay produc antineutrinos). in a more common analog process, call electron capture, some proton-rich nuclid were found to captur their own atom electron instead of emit positrons, and subsequently, these nuclid emit onli a neutrino and a gamma ray from the excit nucleus (and often also auger electron and characterist x-rays, as a result of the re-ord of electron to fill the place of the miss captur electron). these type of decay involv the nuclear captur of electron or emiss of electron or positrons, and thus act to move a nucleus toward the ratio of neutron to proton that has the least energi for a given total number of nucleons. this consequ produc a more stabl (lower energy) nucleus. (a theoret process of positron capture, analog to electron capture, is possibl in antimatt atoms, but has not been observed, as complex antimatt atom beyond antihelium are not experiment available. such a decay would requir antimatt atom at least as complex as which is the lightest known isotop of normal matter to undergo decay by electron capture.) short after the discoveri of the neutron in enrico fermi realiz that certain rare beta-decay reaction immedi yield neutron as a decay particl (neutron emission). isol proton emiss was eventu observ in some elements. it was also found that some heavi element may undergo spontan fission into product that vari in composition. in a phenomenon call cluster decay, specif combin of neutron and proton other than alpha particl (helium nuclei) were found to be spontan emit from atoms. other type of radioact decay were found to emit previous seen particl but via differ mechanisms. an exampl is intern conversion, which result in an initi electron emission, and then often further characterist x-ray and auger electron emissions, although the intern convers process involv neither beta nor gamma decay. a neutrino is not emitted, and none of the electron(s) and photon(s) emit origin in the nucleus, even though the energi to emit all of them doe origin there. intern convers decay, like isomer transit gamma decay and neutron emission, involv the releas of energi by an excit nuclide, without the transmut of one element into another. rare event that involv a combin of two beta-decay-typ event happen simultan are known (see below). ani decay process that doe not violat the conserv of energi or momentum law (and perhap other particl conserv laws) is permit to happen, although not all have been detected. an interest exampl discuss in a final section, is bound state beta decay of in this process, the beta electron-decay of the parent nuclid is not accompani by beta electron emission, becaus the beta particl has been captur into the k-shell of the emit atom. an antineutrino is emitted, as in all negat beta decays. radionuclid can undergo a number of differ reactions. these are summar in the follow table. a nucleus with mass number a and atom number z is repres as (a, z). the column \"daughter nucleus\" indic the differ between the new nucleus and the origin nucleus. thus, (a \u2212 z) mean that the mass number is one less than before, but the atom number is the same as before. if energi circumst are favorable, a given radionuclid may undergo mani compet type of decay, with some atom decay by one route, and other decay by another. an exampl is which has protons, and neutrons, which decay with a half-lif of about hours. this isotop has one unpair proton and one unpair neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay to the other particle, which has opposit isospin. this particular nuclid (though not all nuclid in this situation) is almost equal like to decay through positron emiss or through electron captur as it doe through electron emiss the excit energi state result from these decay which fail to end in a ground energi state, also produc later intern convers and gamma decay in almost of the time. more common in heavi nuclid is competit between alpha and beta decay. the daughter nuclid will then normal decay through beta or alpha, respectively, to end up in the same place. radioact decay result in a reduct of sum rest mass, onc the releas energi (the disintegr energy) has escap in some way. although decay energi is sometim defin as associ with the differ between the mass of the parent nuclid product and the mass of the decay products, this is true onli of rest mass measurements, where some energi has been remov from the product system. this is true becaus the decay energi must alway carri mass with it, wherev it appear (see mass in special relativity) accord to the formula e = the decay energi is initi releas as the energi of emit photon plus the kinet energi of massiv emit particl (that is, particl that have rest mass). if these particl come to thermal equilibrium with their surround and photon are absorbed, then the decay energi is transform to thermal energy, which retain it mass. decay energy, therefore, remain associ with a certain measur of the mass of the decay system, call invari mass, which doe not chang dure the decay, even though the energi of decay is distribut among decay particles. the energi of photons, the kinet energi of emit particles, and, later, the thermal energi of the surround matter, all contribut to the invari mass of the system. thus, while the sum of the rest mass of the particl is not conserv in radioact decay, the system mass and system invari mass (and also the system total energy) is conserv throughout ani decay process. this is a restat of the equival law of conserv of energi and conserv of mass. === mode === == rate == the decay rate, or activity, of a radioact substanc is character by: constant quantities: the is the time taken for the activ of a given amount of a radioact substanc to decay to half of it initi value; see list of nuclides. the decay constant\u2014 \u03bb, \"lambda\" the reciproc of the mean lifetim (in sometim refer to as simpli decay rate. the mean lifetime\u2014 \u03c4, \"tau\" the averag lifetim life) of a radioact particl befor decay.although these are constants, they are associ with the statist behavior of popul of atoms. in consequence, predict use these constant are less accur for minuscul sampl of atoms. in principl a half-life, a third-life, or even a can be use in exact the same way as half-life; but the mean life and half-lif have been adopt as standard time associ with exponenti decay. time-vari quantities: total activity\u2014 a, is the number of decay per unit time of a radioact sample. number of particles\u2014n, is the total number of particl in the sample. specif activity\u2014sa, number of decay per unit time per amount of substanc of the sampl at time set to zero (t = \"amount of substance\" can be the mass, volum or mole of the initi sample.thes are relat as follows: t / = ln \u2061 ( ) \u03bb = \u03c4 ln \u2061 ( ) {\\displaystyl }}=\\tau a = \u2212 d n d t = \u03bb n {\\displaystyl a=-{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} n}{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\lambda n} s a a = \u2212 d n d t | t = = \u03bb n {\\displaystyl {\\mathrm {d} n}{\\mathrm {d} t}}{\\bigg where is the initi amount of activ substanc \u2014 substanc that has the same percentag of unstabl particl as when the substanc was formed. == mathemat == === univers law === the mathemat of radioact decay depend on a key assumpt that a nucleus of a radionuclid has no \"memory\" or way of translat it histori into it present behavior. a nucleus doe not \"age\" with the passag of time. thus, the probabl of it break down doe not increas with time but stay constant, no matter how long the nucleus has existed. this constant probabl may differ great between one type of nuclei and another, lead to the mani differ observ decay rates. however, whatev the probabl is, it doe not chang over time. this is in mark contrast to complex object which do show aging, such as automobil and humans. these age system do have a chanc of breakdown per unit of time that increas from the moment they begin their existence. aggreg processes, like the radioact decay of a lump of atoms, for which the singl event probabl of realiz is veri small but in which the number of time-slic is so larg that there is nevertheless a reason rate of events, are model by the poisson distribution, which is discrete. radioact decay and nuclear particl reaction are two exampl of such aggreg processes. the mathemat of poisson process reduc to the law of exponenti decay, which describ the statist behaviour of a larg number of nuclei, rather than one individu nucleus. in the follow formalism, the number of nuclei or the nuclei popul n, is of cours a discret variabl (a natur number)\u2014but for ani physic sampl n is so larg that it can be treat as a continu variable. differenti calculus is use to model the behaviour of nuclear decay. ==== one-decay process ==== consid the case of a nuclid a that decay into anoth b by some process a \u2192 b (emiss of other particles, like electron neutrino \u03bde and electron e\u2212 as in beta decay, are irrelev in what follows). the decay of an unstabl nucleus is entir random in time so it is imposs to predict when a particular atom will decay. however, it is equal like to decay at ani instant in time. therefore, given a sampl of a particular radioisotope, the number of decay event \u2212dn expect to occur in a small interv of time dt is proport to the number of atom present n, that is \u2212 d n d t \u221d n {\\displaystyl -{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} n}{\\mathrm {d} t}}\\propto n} particular radionuclid decay at differ rates, so each has it own decay constant \u03bb. the expect decay \u2212dn/n is proport to an increment of time, dt: the negat sign indic that n decreas as time increases, as the decay event follow one after another. the solut to this first-ord differenti equat is the function: n ( t ) = n e \u2212 \u03bb t {\\displaystyl }t}} where is the valu of n at time t = with the decay constant express as \u03bbwe have for all time t: n a + n b = n t o t a l = n a , {\\displaystyl n_{a}+n_{b}=n_{\\mathrm {total} where ntotal is the constant number of particl throughout the decay process, which is equal to the initi number of a nuclid sinc this is the initi substance. if the number of non-decay a nuclei is: n a = n a e \u2212 \u03bb t {\\displaystyl }t}} then the number of nuclei of b, i.e. the number of decay a nuclei, is n b = n a \u2212 n a = n a \u2212 n a e \u2212 \u03bb t = n a ( \u2212 e \u2212 \u03bb t ) . {\\displaystyl }t}\\right).} the number of decay observ over a given interv obey poisson statistics. if the averag number of decay is \u27e8n\u27e9, the probabl of a given number of decay n is p ( n ) = \u27e8 n \u27e9 n exp \u2061 ( \u2212 \u27e8 n \u27e9 ) n ! . {\\displaystyl p(n)={\\frac {\\langl n\\rangl ^{n}\\exp(-\\langl n\\rangl )}{n!}}.} ==== chain-decay process ==== chain of two decay now consid the case of a chain of two decays: one nuclid a decay into anoth b by one process, then b decay into anoth c by a second process, i.e. a \u2192 b \u2192 c. the previous equat cannot be appli to the decay chain, but can be general as follows. sinc a decay into b, then b decay into c, the activ of a add to the total number of b nuclid in the present sample, befor those b nuclid decay and reduc the number of nuclid lead to the later sample. in other words, the number of second generat nuclei b increas as a result of the first generat nuclei decay of a, and decreas as a result of it own decay into the third generat nuclei c. the sum of these two term give the law for a decay chain for two nuclides: d n b d t = \u2212 \u03bb b n b + \u03bb a n a . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} n_{b}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}=-\\lambda _{b}n_{b}+\\lambda _{a}n_{a}.} the rate of chang of nb, that is dnb/dt, is relat to the chang in the amount of a and b, nb can increas as b is produc from a and decreas as b produc c. re-writ use the previous results: the subscript simpli refer to the respect nuclides, i.e. na is the number of nuclid of type a; is the initi number of nuclid of type a; \u03bba is the decay constant for a \u2013 and similar for nuclid b. solv this equat for nb gives: n b = n a \u03bb a \u03bb b \u2212 \u03bb a ( e \u2212 \u03bb a t \u2212 e \u2212 \u03bb b t ) . {\\displaystyl n_{b}={\\frac _{a}}{\\lambda _{b}-\\lambda _{a}}}\\left(e^{-\\lambda _{a}t}-e^{-\\lambda _{b}t}\\right).} in the case where b is a stabl nuclid (\u03bbb = this equat reduc to the previous solution: lim \u03bb b \u2192 [ n a \u03bb a \u03bb b \u2212 \u03bb a ( e \u2212 \u03bb a t \u2212 e \u2212 \u03bb b t ) ] = n a \u03bb a \u2212 \u03bb a ( e \u2212 \u03bb a t \u2212 ) = n a ( \u2212 e \u2212 \u03bb a t ) , {\\displaystyl \\lim _{\\lambda _{b}\\rightarrow _{a}}{\\lambda _{b}-\\lambda _{a}}}\\left(e^{-\\lambda _{a}t}-e^{-\\lambda _{b}t}\\right)\\right]={\\frac _{a}}}\\left(e^{-\\lambda _{a}t}\\right),} as shown abov for one decay. the solut can be found by the integr factor method, where the integr factor is e\u03bbbt. this case is perhap the most use sinc it can deriv both the one-decay equat (above) and the equat for multi-decay chain (below) more directly. chain of ani number of decay for the general case of ani number of consecut decay in a decay chain, i.e. \u2192 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2192 ai \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2192 ad, where d is the number of decay and i is a dummi index (i = ...d), each nuclid popul can be found in term of the previous population. in this case = = nd = use the abov result in a recurs form: d n j d t = \u2212 \u03bb j n j + \u03bb j \u2212 n ( j \u2212 ) e \u2212 \u03bb j \u2212 t . {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} n_{j}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}=-\\lambda _{j}n_{j}+\\lambda the general solut to the recurs problem is given by bateman equations: ==== altern mode ==== in all of the abov examples, the initi nuclid decay into just one product. consid the case of one initi nuclid that can decay into either of two products, that is a \u2192 b and a \u2192 c in parallel. for example, in a sampl of of the nuclei decay to and to we have for all time t: n = n a + n b + n c {\\displaystyl n=n_{a}+n_{b}+n_{c}} which is constant, sinc the total number of nuclid remain constant. differenti with respect to time: d n

constant \u03bb in term of the sum of partial decay constant \u03bbb and \u03bbc: \u03bb = \u03bb b + \u03bb c . {\\displaystyl \\lambda =\\lambda _{b}+\\lambda _{c}.} solv this equat for na: n a = n a e \u2212 \u03bb t . {\\displaystyl t}.} where is the initi number of nuclid a. when measur the product of one nuclide, one can onli observ the total decay constant \u03bb. the decay constant \u03bbb and \u03bbc determin the probabl for the decay to result in product b or c as follows: n b = \u03bb b \u03bb n a ( \u2212 e \u2212 \u03bb t ) , {\\displaystyl n_{b}={\\frac {\\lambda _{b}}{\\lambda

the fraction \u03bbc/\u03bb of nuclei decay into c. === corollari of law === the abov equat can also be written use quantiti relat to the number of nuclid particl n in a sample; the activity: a = \u03bbn. the amount of substance: n = n/l. the mass: m = mn = mn/l.where l = is the avogadro constant, m is the molar mass of the substanc in kg/mol, and the amount of the substanc n is in moles. === decay timing: definit and relat === ==== time constant and mean-lif ==== for the one-decay solut a \u2192 b: n = n e \u2212 \u03bb t = n e \u2212 t / \u03c4 , {\\displaystyl },\\,\\!} the equat indic that the decay constant \u03bb has unit of and can thus also be repres as where \u03c4 is a characterist time of the process call the time constant. in a radioact decay process, this time constant is also the mean lifetim for decay atoms. each atom \"lives\" for a finit amount of time befor it decays, and it may be shown that this mean lifetim is the arithmet mean of all the atom lifetimes, and that it is \u03c4, which again is relat to the decay constant as follows: \u03c4 = \u03bb . {\\displaystyl \\tau ={\\frac }}.} this form is also true for two-decay process simultan a \u2192 b + c, insert the equival valu of decay constant (as given above) \u03bb = \u03bb b + \u03bb c {\\displaystyl \\lambda =\\lambda _{b}+\\lambda _{c}\\,} into the decay solut lead to: \u03c4 = \u03bb = \u03bb b + \u03bb c = \u03c4 b + \u03c4 c {\\displaystyl {\\frac }}=\\lambda =\\lambda _{b}+\\lambda _{c}={\\frac _{b}}}+{\\frac _{c}}}\\,} ==== half-lif ==== a more common use paramet is the half-lif given a sampl of a particular radionuclide, the half-lif is the time taken for half the radionuclid atom to decay. for the case of one-decay nuclear reactions: n = n e \u2212 \u03bb t = n e \u2212 t / \u03c4 , {\\displaystyl },\\,\\!} the half-lif is relat to the decay constant as follows: set n = and t = to obtain t / = ln \u2061 \u03bb = \u03c4 ln \u2061 {\\displaystyl {\\ln }}=\\tau \\ln this relationship between the half-lif and the decay constant show that high radioact substanc are quick spent, while those that radiat weak endur longer. half-liv of known radionuclid vari widely, from more than year for the veri near stabl nuclid to x second for high unstabl nuclid such as the factor of in the abov relat result from the fact that the concept of \"half-life\" is mere a way of select a differ base other than the natur base e for the lifetim expression. the time constant \u03c4 is the e -life, the time until onli remains, about rather than the in the half-lif of a radionuclide. thus, \u03c4 is longer than the follow equat can be shown to be valid: n ( t ) = n e \u2212 t / \u03c4 = n \u2212 t / t / . {\\displaystyl sinc radioact decay is exponenti with a constant probability, each process could as easili be describ with a differ constant time period that (for example) gave it (how long until onli is left) or (a time period until onli is left), and so on. thus, the choic of \u03c4 and for marker-times, are onli for convenience, and from convention. they reflect a fundament principl onli in so much as they show that the same proport of a given radioact substanc will decay, dure ani time-period that one chooses. mathematically, the nth life for the abov situat would be found in the same way as above\u2014bi set n = t = and substitut into the decay solut to obtain

where: n n = / \u2248 , {\\displaystyl {\\frac \u03c4 = t / ln \u2061 \u2248 {\\displaystyl \\tau ={\\frac years, t = \u2212 \u03c4 ln \u2061 n n \u2248 {\\displaystyl t=-\\tau \\,\\ln {\\frac years. == chang rate == the radioact decay mode of electron captur and intern convers are known to be slight sensit to chemic and environment effect that chang the electron structur of the atom, which in turn affect the presenc of and electron that particip in the decay process. a small number of most light nuclid are affected. for example, chemic bond can affect the rate of electron captur to a small degre (in general, less than depend on the proxim of electron to the nucleus. in a differ of has been observ between half-liv in metal and insul environments. this relat larg effect is becaus beryllium is a small atom whose valenc electron are in atom orbitals, which are subject to electron captur in becaus (like all s atom orbit in all atoms) they natur penetr into the nucleus. in jung et al. of the darmstadt heavy-ion research group observ an acceler \u03b2\u2212 decay of although neutral is a stabl isotope, the fulli ioniz undergo \u03b2\u2212 decay into the k and l shell to with a half-lif of is anoth spectacular example. normal beta decay to with a half-lif of \u00d7 years, but studi use fulli ionis atom (bare nuclei) have found that this can decreas to onli years. this is attribut to \"bound-stat \u03b2\u2212 decay\" of the fulli ionis atom \u2013 the electron is emit into the \"k-shell\" atom orbital), which cannot occur for neutral atom in which all low-li bound state are occupied. a number of experi have found that decay rate of other mode of artifici and natur occur radioisotop are, to a high degre of precision, unaffect by extern condit such as temperature, pressure, the chemic environment, and electric, magnetic, or gravit fields. comparison of laboratori experi over the last century, studi of the oklo natur nuclear reactor (which exemplifi the effect of thermal neutron on nuclear decay), and astrophys observ of the luminos decay of distant supernova (which occur far away so the light has taken a great deal of time to reach us), for example, strong indic that unperturb decay rate have been constant (at least to within the limit of small experiment errors) as a function of time as well.rec result suggest the possibl that decay rate might have a weak depend on environment factors. it has been suggest that measur of decay rate of and exhibit small season variat (of the order of however, such measur are high suscept to systemat errors, and a subsequ paper has found no evid for such correl in seven other isotop and set upper limit on the size of ani such effects. the decay of was onc report to exhibit larg peak-to-peak season variat (see plot), which were propos to be relat to either solar flare activ or the distanc from the sun, but detail analysi of the experi design flaws, along with comparison to other, much more stringent and systemat controlled, experi refut this claim. === gsi anomali === an unexpect seri of experiment result for the rate of decay of heavi high charg radioact ion circul in a storag ring has provok theoret activ in an effort to find a convinc explanation. the rate of weak decay of two radioact speci with half live of about s and s are found to have a signific oscillatori modulation, with a period of about s. the observ phenomenon is known as the gsi anomaly, as the storag ring is a facil at the gsi helmholtz centr for heavi ion research in darmstadt, germany. as the decay process produc an electron neutrino, some of the propos explan for the observ rate oscil invok neutrino properties. initi idea relat to flavour oscil met with skepticism. a more recent propos involv mass differ between neutrino mass eigenstates. == theoret basi == the neutron and proton that constitut nuclei, as well as other particl that approach close enough to them, are govern by sever interactions. the strong nuclear force, not observ at the familiar macroscop scale, is the most power forc over subatom distances. the electrostat forc is almost alway significant, and, in the case of beta decay, the weak nuclear forc is also involved. the combin effect of these forc produc a number of differ phenomena in which energi may be releas by rearrang of particl in the nucleus, or els the chang of one type of particl into others. these rearrang and transform may be hinder energet so that they do not occur immediately. in certain cases, random quantum vacuum fluctuat are theoriz to promot relax to a lower energi state (the \"decay\") in a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling. radioact decay half-lif of nuclid has been measur over timescal of order of magnitude, from \u00d7 second (for to \u00d7 second (for the limit of these timescal are set by the sensit of instrument only, and there are no known natur limit to how brief or long a decay half-lif for radioact decay of a radionuclid may be. the decay process, like all hinder energi transformations, may be analog by a snowfield on a mountain. while friction between the ice crystal may be support the snow weight, the system is inher unstabl with regard to a state of lower potenti energy. a disturb would thus facilit the path to a state of greater entropy; the system will move toward the ground state, produc heat, and the total energi will be distribut over a larger number of quantum state thus result in an avalanche. the total energi doe not chang in this process, but, becaus of the second law of thermodynamics, avalanch have onli been observ in one direct and that is toward the \"ground state\" \u2014 the state with the largest number of way in which the avail energi could be distributed. such a collaps (a gamma-ray decay event) requir a specif activ energy. for a snow avalanche, this energi come as a disturb from outsid the system, although such disturb can be arbitrarili small. in the case of an excit atom nucleus decay by gamma radiat in a spontan emiss of electromagnet radiation, the arbitrarili small disturb come from quantum vacuum fluctuations.a radioact nucleus (or ani excit system in quantum mechanics) is unstable, and can, thus, spontan stabil to a less-excit system. the result transform alter the structur of the nucleus and result in the emiss of either a photon or a high-veloc particl that has mass (such as an electron, alpha particle, or other type). == occurr and applic == accord to the big bang theory, stabl isotop of the lightest five element (h, he, and trace of li, be, and b) were produc veri short after the emerg of the universe, in a process call big bang nucleosynthesis. these lightest stabl nuclid (includ deuterium) surviv to today, but ani radioact isotop of the light element produc in the big bang (such as tritium) have long sinc decayed. isotop of element heavier than boron were not produc at all in the big bang, and these first five element do not have ani long-liv radioisotopes. thus, all radioact nuclei are, therefore, relat young with respect to the birth of the universe, have form later in various other type of nucleosynthesi in star (in particular, supernovae), and also dure ongo interact between stabl isotop and energet particles. for example, a radioact nuclid with a half-lif of onli years, is constant produc in earth upper atmospher due to interact between cosmic ray and nitrogen. nuclid that are produc by radioact decay are call radiogen nuclides, whether they themselv are stabl or not. there exist stabl radiogen nuclid that were form from short-liv extinct radionuclid in the earli solar system. the extra presenc of these stabl radiogen nuclid (such as from extinct against the background of primordi stabl nuclid can be infer by various means. radioact decay has been put to use in the techniqu of radioisotop labeling, which is use to track the passag of a chemic substanc through a complex system (such as a live organism). a sampl of the substanc is synthes with a high concentr of unstabl atoms. the presenc of the substanc in one or anoth part of the system is determin by detect the locat of decay events. on the premis that radioact decay is truli random (rather than mere chaotic), it has been use in hardwar random-numb generators. becaus the process is not thought to vari signific in mechan over time, it is also a valuabl tool in estim the absolut age of certain materials. for geolog materials, the radioisotop and some of their decay product becom trap when a rock solidifies, and can then later be use (subject to mani well-known qualifications) to estim the date of the solidification. these includ check the result of sever simultan process and their product against each other, within the same sample. in a similar fashion, and also subject to qualification, the rate of format of in various eras, the date of format of organ matter within a certain period relat to the isotop half-lif may be estimated, becaus the becom trap when the organ matter grow and incorpor the new from the air. thereafter, the amount of in organ matter decreas accord to decay process that may also be independ cross-check by other mean (such as check the in individu tree rings, for example). === szilard\u2013chalm effect === the szilard\u2013chalm effect is the break of a chemic bond as a result of a kinet energi impart from radioact decay. it oper by the absorpt of neutron by an atom and subsequ emiss of gamma rays, often with signific amount of kinet energy. this kinet energy, by newton third law, push back on the decay atom, which caus it to move with enough speed to break a chemic bond. this effect can be use to separ isotop by chemic means. the szilard\u2013chalm effect was discov in by le\u00f3 szil\u00e1rd and thoma a. chalmers. they observ that after bombard by neutrons, the break of a bond in liquid ethyl iodid allow radioact iodin to be removed. == origin of radioact nuclid == radioact primordi nuclid found in the earth are residu from ancient supernova explos that occur befor the format of the solar system. they are the fraction of radionuclid that surviv from that time, through the format of the primordi solar nebula, through planet accretion, and up to the present time. the natur occur short-liv radiogen radionuclid found in today rocks, are the daughter of those radioact primordi nuclides. anoth minor sourc of natur occur radioact nuclid are cosmogen nuclides, that are form by cosmic ray bombard of materi in the earth atmospher or crust. the decay of the radionuclid in rock of the earth mantl and crust contribut signific to earth intern heat budget. == decay chain and multipl mode == the daughter nuclid of a decay event may also be unstabl (radioactive). in this case, it too will decay, produc radiation. the result second daughter nuclid may also be radioactive. this can lead to a sequenc of sever decay event call a decay chain (see this articl for specif detail of import natur decay chains). eventually, a stabl nuclid is produced. ani decay daughter that are the result of an alpha decay will also result in helium atom be created. an exampl is the natur decay chain of decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-lif of billion year to which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-lif of day to which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-lif of minut to which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-lif of thousand year to which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-lif of thousand year to which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-lif of thousand year to which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-lif of day to which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-lif of minut to

(the style guid for cern, however, specif say to alway use \"kelvin\", even when plural.)befor the cgpm in the unit kelvin was call a \"degree\", the same as with the other temperatur scale at the time. it was distinguish from the other scale with either the adject suffix \"kelvin\" (\"degre kelvin\") or with \"absolute\" (\"degre absolute\") and it symbol was \u00b0k. the latter term (degre absolute), which was the unit offici name from until was ambigu sinc it could also be interpret as refer to the rankin scale. befor the cgpm, the plural form was \"degre absolute\". the cgpm chang the unit name to simpli \"kelvin\" (symbol: k). the omiss of \"degree\" indic that it is not relat to an arbitrari refer point like the celsius and fahrenheit scale (although the rankin scale continu to use \"degre rankine\"), but rather an absolut unit of measur which can be manipul algebra (e.g. multipli by two to indic twice the amount of \"mean energy\" avail among elementari degre of freedom of the system). == redefinit == in the cipm embark on a programm to redefin the kelvin (along with the other si units) use a more experiment rigor methodology. in particular, the committe propos redefin the kelvin such that boltzmann constant take the exact valu j/k. the committe had hope that the programm would be complet in time for it adopt by the cgpm at it meeting, but at the meet the decis was postpon to the meet when it would be consid as part of a larger programme.th redefinit was further postpon in pend more accur measur of boltzmann constant in term of the current definition, but was final adopt at the cgpm in late with a valu of k = j/k.from a scientif point of view, the main advantag is that this will allow measur at veri low and veri high temperatur to be made more accurately, as the techniqu use depend on the boltzmann constant. it also has the philosoph advantag of be independ of ani particular substance. the unit j/k is equal to where the kilogram, metr and second are defin in term of the planck constant, the speed of light, and the durat of the ground-stat hyperfin transit respectively. thus, this definit depend onli on univers constants, and not on ani physic artifact as practic previously, such as the intern prototyp of the kilogram, whose mass diverg over time from the origin value. the challeng was to avoid degrad the accuraci of measur close to the tripl point. from a practic point of view, the redefinit will pass unnoticed; water will still freez at k \u00b0c), and the tripl point of water will continu to be a common use laboratori refer temperature. the differ is that, befor the redefinition, the tripl point of water was exact and the boltzmann constant had a measur valu of j/k, with a relat standard uncertainti of afterward, the boltzmann constant is exact and the uncertainti is transfer to the tripl point of water, which is now k. == practic use == === colour temperatur === the kelvin is often use as a measur of the colour temperatur of light sources. colour temperatur is base upon the principl that a black bodi radiat emit light with a frequenc distribut characterist of it temperature. black bodi at temperatur below about k appear reddish, wherea those abov about k appear bluish. colour temperatur is import in the field of imag project and photography, where a colour temperatur of approxim k is requir to match \"daylight\" film emulsions. in astronomy, the stellar classif of star and their place on the hertzsprung\u2013russel diagram are based, in part, upon their surfac temperature, known as effect temperature. the photospher of the sun, for instance, has an effect temperatur of k. digit camera and photograph softwar often use colour temperatur in k in edit and setup menus. the simpl guid is that higher colour temperatur produc an imag with enhanc white and blue hues. the reduct in colour temperatur produc an imag more domin by reddish, \"warmer\" colours. === kelvin as a unit of nois temperatur === in electronics, the kelvin is use as an indic of how noisi a circuit is in relat to an ultim nois floor, i.e. the nois temperature. the so-cal johnson\u2013nyquist nois of discret resistor and capacitor is a type of thermal nois deriv from the boltzmann constant and can be use to determin the nois temperatur of a circuit use the frii formula for noise. == unicod charact == the symbol is encod in unicod at code point k kelvin sign. however, this is a compat charact provid for compat with legaci encodings. the unicod standard recommend use k latin capit letter k instead;

\u00b0c). there are four quart in a gallon, the imperi pint is defin as litr (i.e. gallon) and there are imperi fluid ounc in an imperi pint. === us liquid gallon === the us liquid gallon (frequent call simpli \"gallon\") is legal defin as cubic inches, which is exact litres. a us liquid gallon of water weigh about pound or kilogram at \u00b0f \u00b0c), make it about lighter than the imperi gallon. there are four quart in a gallon, two pint in a quart and us fluid ounc in a us pint, which make the us fluid ounc equal to of a us gallon. in order to overcom the effect of expans and

liberia, nicaragua, and peru. in the turk & caico islands, both the u.s. gallon and imperi gallon are used. this is due to an increas in tax duti which was disguis by levi the same duti on the u.s. gallon l) as was previous levi on the imperi gallon l). == relationship to other unit == both the us liquid and imperi gallon are divid into four quart (quarter gallons), which in turn are divid into two pints, which in turn are divid into two cups, which in turn are further divid into two gills. thus, both gallon are equal to four quarts, eight pints, sixteen cups, or thirty-two gills. the imperi gill is further divid into five fluid ounces, wherea the us gill is divid into four fluid ounces, mean an imperi fluid ounc is of an imperi pint, or of an imperi gallon, while a us fluid ounc is of a us pint, or of a us gallon. thus, the imperi gallon, quart, pint, cup and gill are approxim larger than their us counterparts, mean these are not interchangeable, but the imperi fluid ounc is onli approxim smaller than the us fluid ounce, mean these are often use interchangeably. historically, a common bottl size for liquor in the us was the \"fifth\", i.e. one-fifth of a us gallon (or

among them were pehr elvius, the secretari of the royal swedish academi of scienc (which had an instrument workshop) and with whom linnaeus had been corresponding; daniel ekstr\u00f6m, the instrument maker; and m\u00e5rten str\u00f6mer who had studi astronomi under ander celsius. the first known swedish document report temperatur in this modern \"forward\" celsius scale is the paper hortus upsaliensi date decemb that linnaeus wrote to a student of his, samuel naucl\u00e9r. in it, linnaeus recount the temperatur insid the orangeri at the univers of uppsala botan garden: ...sinc the caldarium (the hot part of the greenhouse) by the angl of the windows, mere from the ray of the sun, obtain such heat that the thermomet often reach degrees, although the keen garden usual take care not to let it rise to more than to degrees, and in winter not under degrees... === centigrad versus celsius === sinc the century, the scientif and thermometri communiti worldwid have use the phrase \"centigrad scale\" and temperatur were often report simpli as \"degrees\" or, when greater specif was desired, as \"degre centigrade\", with the symbol \u00b0c. however, the term centigrad was also use in the spanish and french languag as a unit of angular measur of a right angle), and it had a similar connot in other languages. the term centesim degre or gradian (\"grad\" or \"gon\": = = was use when unambigu languag was requir by intern standard bodi such as the bipm. it would more proper now be call \"hectograde\". to elimin confus between the unit of temperatur and the unit of angular measurement, the meet of the general confer on weight and measur and the comit\u00e9 intern des poid et mesur (cipm) formal adopt \"degre celsius\" in for the degre of temperature, and kept the recogn degre symbol (\u00b0), rather than adopt the gradian/centesim degre symbol (g or gon).for scientif use, \"celsius\" is the term usual used, but in english-speak countri \"centigrade\" remain in common use, especi in inform contexts. it was not even until februari that the weather forecast issu by the bbc switch the term from \"centigrade\" to \"celsius\". === common temperatur === some key temperatur relat the celsius scale to other temperatur scale are shown in the tabl below. == name and symbol typeset == the \"degre celsius\" has been the onli si unit whose full unit name contain an uppercas letter sinc when the si base unit for temperatur becam the kelvin, replac the capit term degre kelvin. the plural form is \"degre celsius\".th general rule of the intern bureau of weight and measur (bipm) is that the numer valu alway preced the unit, and a space is alway use to separ the unit from the number, e.g. \u00b0c\" (not or c\"). the onli except to this rule are for the unit symbol for degree, minute, and second for plane angl (\u00b0, \u2032, and \u2033, respectively), for which no space is left between the numer valu and the unit symbol. other languages, and various publish houses, may follow differ typograph rules. === unicod charact === unicod provid the celsius symbol at code point \u2103 degre celsius. however, this is a compat charact provid for roundtrip compat with legaci encodings. it easili allow correct render for vertic written east asian scripts, such as chinese. the unicod standard explicit discourag the use of this character: \"in normal use, it is better to repres degre celsius \"\u00b0c\" with a sequenc of \u00b0 degre sign + c latin capit letter c, rather than \u2103 degre celsius. for searching, treat these two sequenc as identical.\" == temperatur and interv == the degre celsius is subject to the same rule as the kelvin with regard to the use of it unit name and symbol. thus, besid express specif temperatur along it scale (e.g. \"gallium melt at \u00b0c\" and \"the temperatur outsid is degre celsius\"), the degre celsius is also suitabl for express temperatur intervals: differ between temperatur or their uncertainti (e.g. \"the output of the heat exchang is hotter by degre celsius\", and \"our standard uncertainti is \u00b0c\"). becaus of this dual usage, one must not reli upon the unit name or it symbol to denot that a quantiti is a temperatur interval; it must be unambigu through context or explicit statement that the quantiti is an interval. this is sometim solv by use the symbol \u00b0c (pronounc \"degre celsius\") for a temperature, and c\u00b0 (pronounc \"celsius degrees\") for a temperatur interval, although this usag is non-standard. anoth way to express the same is \u00b0c \u00b1 k\", which can be common found in literature. celsius measur follow an interv system but not a ratio system; and it follow a relat scale not an absolut scale. for example, an object at \u00b0c doe not have twice the energi of when it is \u00b0c; and \u00b0c is not the lowest celsius value. thus, degre celsius is a use interv measur but doe not possess the characterist of ratio measur like weight or distance. == coexist of kelvin and celsius scale == in scienc and in engineering, the celsius scale and the kelvin scale are often use in combin in close contexts, e.g. \"a measur valu was \u00b0c with an uncertainti of \u03bck\". this practic is permiss becaus the magnitud of the degre celsius is equal to that of the kelvin. notwithstand the offici endors provid by decis no. of resolut of the cgpm, which state \"a temperatur interv may also be express in degre celsius\", the practic of simultan use both \u00b0c and k remain widespread throughout the scientif world as the use of si-prefix form of the degre celsius (such as \"\u03bc\u00b0c\" or \"microdegre celsius\") to express a temperatur interv has not been well-adopted. == melt and boil point of water == the melt and boil point of water are no longer part of the definit of the celsius scale. in the definit was chang to use the tripl point of water. in the definit was further refin to use water with precis defin isotop composit (vsmow) for the tripl point. in the definit was chang to use the boltzmann constant, complet decoupl the definit of the kelvin from the properti of water. each of these formal definit left the numer valu of the celsius scale ident to the prior definit to within the limit of accuraci of the metrolog of the time. when the melt and boil point of water ceas be part of the definition, they becam measur quantiti instead. this is also true of the tripl point. in when the general confer on weight and measur (cgpm) in resolut first consid use the tripl point of water as a defin point, the tripl point was so close to be \u00b0c greater than water known melt point, it was simpli defin as precis \u00b0c. however, later measur show that the differ between the tripl and melt point of vsmow is actual veri slight \u00b0c) greater than \u00b0c. thus, the actual melt point of ice is veri slight (less than a thousandth of a degree) below \u00b0c. also, defin water tripl point at k precis defin the magnitud of each \u00b0c increment in term of the absolut thermodynam temperatur scale (referenc absolut zero). now decoupl from the actual boil point of water, the valu \u00b0c\" is hotter than \u00b0c \u2013 in absolut term \u2013 by a factor of precis (approxim thermodynam hotter). when adher strict to the two-point definit for calibration, the boil point of vsmow under one standard atmospher of pressur was actual k \u00b0c). when calibr to (a calibr standard compris mani definit point and common use for high-precis instrumentation), the boil point of vsmow was slight less, about \u00b0c.this boiling-point differ of millikelvin between the celsius scale origin definit and the previous one (base on absolut zero and the tripl point) has littl practic mean in common daili applic becaus water boil point is veri sensit to variat in barometr pressure. for example, an altitud chang of onli cm in) caus the boil point to chang by one millikelvin. == see also == comparison of temperatur scale degre of frost r\u00e9aumur scale thermodynam temperatur == note == == refer == == extern link == the dictionari definit of celsius at wiktionari nist, basic unit definitions: kelvin the uppsala astronom observatory, histori of the celsius temperatur scale london south bank university, water, scientif data bipm, si brochure, section unit of thermodynam temperatur tampile, comparison of temperatur scale",

and- (a) the yard shall be metr exactly; (b) the pound shall be kilogram exactly. an avoirdupoi pound is equal to avoirdupoi ounc and to exact grains. the convers factor between the kilogram and the intern pound was therefor chosen to be divis by and an (international) grain is thus equal to exact milligrams. in the uk, the process of metric and european unit of measur direct were expect to elimin the use of the pound and ounce, but in the european commiss abandon the requir for metric-on label on packag good there, and allow for dual metric\u2013imperi mark to continu indefinitely. when use as a measur of bodi weight the uk practic remain to use the stone of pound as the primari measur e.g. stone pounds\", rather than pounds\" (as done in the us), or kilograms\" as use elsewhere. the us has not adopt the metric system despit mani effort to do so, and the pound remain wide use as one of the key unit state customari units. == histor use == historically, in differ part of the world, at differ point in time, and for differ applications, the pound (or it translation) has refer to broad similar but not ident standard of mass or force. === roman libra === the libra (latin for \"scale / balance\") is an ancient roman unit of mass that was equival to approxim grams. it was divid into uncia (singular: uncia), or ounces. the libra is the origin of the abbrevi for pound, \"lb\". === in britain === a number of differ definit of the pound have histor been use in britain. amongst these were the avoirdupoi pound and the obsolet tower, merchant and london pounds. troy pound and ounc remain in use onli for the weight of certain precious metals, especi in the trade; these are normal quot just in ounc (e.g. ounces\") and, when the type of ounc is not explicit stated, the troy system is assumed. historically, the pound sterl was a tower pound of silver. in the standard was chang to the troy pound. ==== avoirdupoi pound ==== the avoirdupoi pound, also known as the wool pound, first came into general use c. it was initi equal to troy grains. the pound avoirdupoi was divid into ounces. dure the reign of queen elizabeth, the avoirdupoi pound was redefin as troy grains. sinc then, the grain has often been an integr part of the avoirdupoi system. by two elizabethan exchequ standard weight for the avoirdupoi pound existed, and when measur in troy grain they were found to be of grain and grains. ===== imperi standard pound ===== in the unit kingdom, weight and measur have been defin by a long seri of act of parliament, the intent of which has been to regul the sale of commodities. materi trade in the marketplac are quantifi accord to accept unit and standard in order to avoid fraud. the standard themselv are legal defin so as to facilit the resolut of disput brought to the courts; onli legal defin measur will be recognis by the courts. quantifi devic use by trader (weights, weigh machines, contain of volumes, measur of length) are subject to offici inspection, and penalti appli if they are fraudulent. the weight and measur act mark a major overhaul of the british system of weight and measures, and the definit of the pound given there remain in forc until the the pound was defin thus (section \"the ... platinum weight ... deposit in the standard depart of the board of trade ... shall continu to be the imperi standard of ... weight ... and the said platinum weight shall continu to be the imperi standard for determin the imperi standard pound for the unit kingdom\". paragraph state that the weight in vacuo of this standard shall be call the imperi standard pound, and that all other weight mention in the act and permiss for commerc shall be ascertain from it alone. the first schedul of the act gave more detail of the standard pound: it is a platinum cylind near inch mm) high, and inch mm) diameter, and the edg are care round off. it has a groov about inch mm) from the top, to allow the cylind to be lift use an ivori fork. it was construct follow the destruct of the hous of parliament by fire in and is stamp p.s. lb (p.s. stand for \"parliamentari standard\"). the pound was redefin in the unit kingdom by the weight and measur act as a fraction of the standard kilogram: \"the pound shall be kilogramm exactly\". ===== relationship to the kilogram ===== the act said that contract word in term of metric unit would be deem by the court to be made accord to the imperi unit defin in the act, and a tabl of metric equival was suppli so that the imperi equival could be legal calculated. this defined, in uk law, metric unit in term of imperi ones. the equival for the pound was given as lb = g or kg, which made the kilogram equival to about lb. in it was determin joint by the standard depart of the board of trade and the bureau intern that kg was a better approximation, and this figure, round to kg was given legal status by an order in council in may in a new weight and measur act revers this relationship and the pound was defin for the first time as a mass equal to kg to match the definit of the intern pound agre in ==== troy pound ==== a troy pound (abbrevi lb t) is equal to troy ounc and to grains, that is exact grams. troy weight were use in england by jewellers. apothecari also use the troy pound and ounce, but ad the drachm and scrupl unit in the apothecari system of weights. troy weight may take it name from the french market town of troy in franc where english merchant trade at least as earli as the earli century.th troy pound is no longer in general use or a legal unit for trade (it was abolish in the unit kingdom on januari by the weight and measur act of but the troy ounce, of a troy pound, is still use for measur of gem such as opals, and precious metal such as silver, platinum and particular gold. ==== tower pound ==== the system call tower weight was the more general name for king offa pound. this date to ad and was base on the silver penny. the tower pound was also call the money pound (refer to the saxon money befor the conquest), the easterl pound, which may refer to trader of eastern germany, or to trader on the shore of the eastern baltic sea, or dealer of asiat good who settl at the steelyard wharf; and the rochell pound by french writers, becaus it was also in use at rochelle. an almost ident weight was employ by the german for weigh gold and silver. the mercantil pound of troy grains, or tower grains, deriv from this pound, as shilling-weight or tower ounces, for general commerci use. multipl pound base on the same ounc were quit common. in much of europe, the apothecari and commerci pound were differ number of the same ounce.th tower system was referenc to a standard prototyp found in the tower of london and ran concurr with the avoirdupoi and troy system until the reign of henri viii, when a royal proclam date requir that the troy pound to be use for mint purpos instead of the tower pound. no standard of the tower pound are known to have survived.th tower pound was equival to about grams. ==== merchant pound ==== the merchant pound (mercantil pound, libra mercantoria, or commerci pound) was consid to be compos of rather than tower shill of pence. it was equal to wheat grain tower ounc or grains) and was use in england until the centuri for good other than money and medicin (\"electuaries\"). ==== london pound ==== the london pound is that of the hansa, as use in their various trade places. the london pound is base on ounces, each ounc divid as the tower ounce. it never becam a legal standard in england; the use of this pound wax and wane with the influenc of the hansa itself. a london pound was equal to troy grain troy ounces) or, equivalently, tower grain tower ounces). === in the unit state === in the unit states, the avoirdupoi pound as a unit of mass has been offici defin in term of the kilogram sinc the mendenhal order of that order defin the pound to be pound to a kilogram. the follow year, this relationship was refin as pound to a kilogram, follow a determin of the british pound.in the unit state nation bureau of standard redefin the pound (avoirdupois) to be exact equal to kilograms, as had been declar by the intern yard and pound agreement of that year. accord to a nist publication, the unit state pound differ from the intern pound by approxim one part in million. the differ is so insignific that it can be ignor for almost all practic purposes. === byzantin litra === the byzantin use a seri of measur known as pound (latin: libra, greek: \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, litra). the most common was the logarik\u0113 litra (\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"pound of account\"), establish by constantin the great in it form the basi of the byzantin monetari system, with one litra of gold equival to solidi. a hundr litrai were known as a kent\u0113narion (\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \"hundredweight\"). it weight seem to have decreas gradual from the origin gram to due to it associ with gold, it was also known as the chrysaphik\u0113 litra (\u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"gold pound\") or thalassia litra (\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"maritim pound\"), but it could also be use as a measur of land, equal a fortieth of the thalassio modios.th soualia litra was specif use for weigh oliv oil or wood, and correspond to of the logarik\u0113, i.e. g. some out regions, especi in later times, adopt various local measures, base on italian, arab or turkish measures. the most import of these was the argyrik\u0113 litra (\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, \"silver pound\") of g, found in trebizond and cyprus, and probabl of arab origin. === french livr === sinc the middl ages, various pound (livre) have been use in france. sinc the century, a livr has refer to the metric pound, the livr esterlin was equival to about gram gr) and was use between the late centuri and the century.th livr poid de marc or livr de pari was equival to about gram gr) and was use between the and the late century. it was introduc by the govern of john ii. the livr m\u00e9triqu was set equal to the kilogram by the decre of brumair an ix between and this was a form of offici metric pound.th livr usuell (customari unit) was defin as gram by the decre of march it was abolish as a unit of mass effect januari by a decre of juli but is still use informally. === german and austrian pfund === origin deriv from the roman libra, the definit vari throughout germani in the middl age and onward. the measur and weight of the habsburg monarchi were reform in by empress maria theresia of austria. the unusu heavi habsburg (civil) pound of ounc was later defin in term of grams. bavarian reform in and adopt essenti the same standard pound. in prussia, a reform in defin a uniform civil pound in term of the prussian foot and distil water, result in a prussian pound of grams. between and all german region west of the river rhine were french, organis in the departements: roer, sarre, rhin-et-moselle, and mont-tonnerre. as a result of the congress of vienna, these becam part of various german states. however, mani of these region retain the metric system and adopt a metric pound of precis grams. in the pound of gram also becam the offici mass standard of the german custom union, but local pound continu to co-exist with the zollverein pound for some time in some german states. nowadays, the term pfund is sometim still in use and univers refer to a pound of grams. === russian funt === the russian pound (\u0444\u0443\u043d\u0442, funt) is an obsolet russian unit of measur of mass. it is equal to grams. in the funt was the basic unit of weight, and all other unit of weight were form from it; in particular, a zolotnik was of a funt, and a pood was funts. === sk\u00e5lpund === the sk\u00e5lpund was a scandinavian measur that vari in weight between regions. from the centuri onward, it was equal to gram in sweden but was abandon in when sweden switch to the metric system. in norway, the same name was use for a weight of grams. in denmark, it equal grams. in the century, denmark follow germani lead and redefin the pound as grams. === portugues libra and arr\u00e1tel === the portugues unit that correspond to the pound of differ nation is the arratel, equival to ounc of colonha, a variant of the cologn standard. this arratel was introduc in by manuel i, king of portugal. base on an evalu of bronz nest weight pile distribut by manuel i to differ towns, the arr\u00e1tel of manuel i has been estim to be of g. in the earli century, the arratel was evalu at g.in the century, the arratel was of ounc of colonha or g. the portugues libra was the same as arr\u00e1tels. there were also arratel of and ounc and libra of and ounces. the troy or tria standard was also used. === jersey pound === a jersey pound is an obsolet unit of mass use on the island of jersey from the centuri to the century. it was equival to about grain grams). it may have been deriv from the french livr poid de marc. === trone pound === the trone pound is one of a number of obsolet scottish unit of measurement. it was equival to between and avoirdupoi ounc (about grams). === metric pound === in mani countries, upon the introduct of a metric system, the pound (or it translation) becam an inform term for grams. in german, the term is pfund, in french livre, in dutch pond, in spanish and portugues libra, in italian libbra, and in danish and swedish pund. though not from the same linguist origin, the chines j\u012bn (\u65a4, also known as \"catty\") has a modern definit of exact grams, divid into li\u01ceng (\u4e24). tradit about grams, the jin has been in use for more than two thousand years, serv the same purpos as \"pound\" for the common-us measur of weight. hundr of older pound were replac in this way. exampl of the older pound are one of around to gram in spain, portugal, and latin america; one of gram in norway; and sever differ one in what is now germany. although the use of the pound as an inform term persist in these countri to a vari degree, scale and measur devic are denomin onli in gram and kilograms. a pound of product must be determin by weigh the product in gram as the use of the pound is not sanction for trade within the european union. == use in weaponri == smoothbor cannon and carronad are design by the weight in imperi pound of round solid iron shot of diamet to fit the barrel. a cannon that fire a six-pound ball, for example, is call a six-pounder. standard size are and pounds;

the inch is denot by a doubl prime, which is often approxim by doubl quotes, and the foot by a prime, which is often approxim by an apostrophe. for example; three feet, two inch can be written as (this is akin to how the first and second \"cuts\" of the hour are likewis indic by prime and doubl prime symbols, and also the first and second cut of the degree.) subdivis of an inch are typic written use dyadic fraction with odd number numerators; for example, two and three-eighth of an inch would be written as and not as nor as however, for engin purpos fraction are common given to three

the earli century, surviv in a singl manuscript, the textus roffensi from paragraph lxvii set out the fine for wound of various depths: one inch, one shilling; two inches, two shillings, etc.an anglo-saxon unit of length was the barleycorn. after inch was equal to barleycorns, which continu to be it legal definit for sever centuries, with the barleycorn be the base unit. one of the earliest such definit is that of where the legal definit of the inch was set out in a statut of edward ii of england, defin it as \"three grain of barley, dri and round, place end to end, lengthwise\".similar definit are record in both english and welsh mediev law tracts. one, date from the first half of the century, is contain in the law of hywel dda which supersed those of dyfnwal, an even earlier definit of the inch in wales. both definitions, as record in ancient law and institut of wale (vol i., pp. are that \"three length of a barleycorn is the inch\".k david i of scotland in his assiz of weight and measur (c. is said to have defin the scottish inch as the width of an averag man thumb at the base of the nail, even includ the requir to calcul the averag of a small, a medium, and a larg man measures. however, the oldest surviv manuscript date from the earli centuri and appear to have been alter with the inclus of newer material.in charl butler, a mathemat teacher at cheam school, record the old legal definit of the inch to be \"three grain of sound ripe barley be taken out the middl of the ear, well dried, and laid end to end in a row\", and place the barleycorn, not the inch, as the base unit of the english long measur system, from which all other unit were derived. john bouvier similar record in his law dictionari that the barleycorn was the fundament measure. butler observed, however, that \"[a] the length of the barley-corn cannot be fixed, so the inch accord to this method will be uncertain\", note that a standard inch measur was now [i.e. by kept in the exchequ chamber, guildhall, and that was the legal definit of the inch.thi was a point also made by georg long in his penni cyclop\u00e6dia, observ that standard measur had sinc surpass the barleycorn definit of the inch, and that to recov the inch measur from it origin definition, in the event that the standard measur were destroyed, would involv the measur of larg number of barleycorn and take their averag lengths. he note that this process would not perfect recov the standard, sinc it might introduc error of anywher between one hundredth and one tenth of an inch in the definit of a yard.befor the adopt of the intern yard and pound, various definit were in use. in the unit kingdom and most countri of the british commonwealth, the inch was defin in term of the imperi standard yard. the unit state adopt the convers factor metr = inch by an act in in mendenhal order the physic realiz of the inch to be base on the intern prototyp metr number and which had been receiv from the cgpm, togeth with the previous adopt convers factor.a a result of the definit above, the u.s. inch was effect defin as mm (with a refer temperatur of degre fahrenheit) and the uk inch at mm (with a refer temperatur of degre fahrenheit). when carl edvard johansson start manufactur gaug block in inch size in johansson compromis was to manufactur gaug block with a nomin size of with a refer

    "lumber also known as timber is a type of wood that has been process into beam and plank a stage in the process of wood product lumber is main use for structur purpos but has mani other use as well there are two main type of lumber it may be suppli either rough sawn or surfac on one or more of it face besid pulpwood rough lumber is the raw materi for furnitur make and other item requir addit cut and shape it is avail in mani speci usual hardwood but it is also readili avail in softwood such as white pine and red pine becaus of their low cost finish lumber is suppli in standard size most for the construct industri primarili softwood from conifer speci includ pine fir and spruce collect spruce pine fir cedar and hemlock but also some hardwood for high grade floor it is more common made from softwood than hardwoods, and of lumber come from softwood. == terminolog == in the unit state and canada, mill board are call lumber, while timber describ stand or fell trees.in contrast, in britain and mani other commonwealth nations, the term timber is use for both senses. (the word lumber is rare use in relat to wood and has sever other meanings, includ unus or unwant items.) === re-manufactur lumber === re-manufactur lumber is the result of secondari or tertiari processing/cut of previous mill lumber. specifically, it is lumber cut for industri or wood-packag use. lumber is cut by ripsaw or resaw to creat dimens that are not usual process by a primari sawmill. re-saw is the split of by millimetr by in) hardwood or softwood lumber into two or more thinner piec of full-length boards. for example, split a ft) long by mm by in) into two by mm by in) of the same length is consid re-sawing. === plastic lumber === structur lumber may also be produc from recycl plastic and new plastic stock. it introduct has been strong oppos by the forestri industry. blend fiberglass in plastic lumber enhanc it strength, durability, and fire resistance. plastic fiberglass structur lumber can have a \"class flame spread rate of or less, when test in accord with astm standard e which mean it burn more slowli than almost all treat wood lumber. == convers of wood log == log are convert into timber by be sawn, hewn, or split. saw with a rip saw is the most common method, becaus saw allow log of lower quality, with irregular grain and larg knots, to be use and is more economical. there are various type of sawing: plain sawn (flat sawn, through and through, bastard sawn) \u2013 a log sawn through without adjust the posit of the log and the grain run across the width of the boards. quarter sawn and rift sawn \u2013 these term have been confus in histori but general mean lumber sawn so the annual ring are reason perpendicular to the side (not edges) of the lumber. box heart \u2013 the pith remain within the piec with some allow for exposure. heart center \u2013 the center core of a log. free of heart center (fohc) \u2013 a side-cut timber without ani pith. free of knot (fok) \u2013 no knot are present. == dimension lumber == dimension lumber is lumber that is cut to standard width and depth, often specifi in millimetr or inches. carpent extens use dimension lumber in frame wooden buildings. common size includ (pictured) (also two-by-four and other variants, such as four-by-two in australia, new zealand, and the uk), and the length of a board is usual specifi separ from the width and depth. it is thus possibl to find that are four, eight, and twelv feet in length. in canada and the unit states, the standard length of lumber are and feet and m). for wall framing, precut \"stud\" length are available, and are common used. for ceil height of or feet or m), stud are avail in inch m), inch m), and inch m). === north american softwood === the length of a unit of dimension lumber is limit by the height and girth of the tree it is mill from. in general the maximum length is ft m). engin wood products, manufactur by bind the strands, particles, fibers, or veneer of wood, togeth with adhesives, to form composit materials, offer more flexibl and greater structur strength than typic wood build materials.pre-cut stud save a framer much time, becaus they are pre-cut by the manufactur for use in and ceil applications, which mean the manufactur has remov a few inch or centimetr of the piec to allow for the sill plate and the doubl top plate with no addit size necessary. in the americas, two-bi and name for tradit board thick in inches, along with the mm \u00d7 mm), are common lumber size use in modern construction. they are the basic build block for such common structur as balloon-fram or platform-fram housing. dimension lumber made from softwood is typic use for construction, while hardwood board are more common use for make cabinet or furniture. lumber nomin dimens are larger than the actual standard dimens of finish lumber. historically, the nomin dimens were the size of the green (not dried), rough (unfinished) board that eventu becam smaller finish lumber through dri and plane (to smooth the wood). today, the standard specifi the final finish dimens and the mill cut the log to whatev size it need to achiev those final dimensions. typically, that rough cut is smaller than the nomin dimens becaus modern technolog make it possibl to use the log more efficiently. for example, a board histor start out as a green, rough board actual by inch mm \u00d7 mm). after dri and planing, it would be smaller by a nonstandard amount. today, a board start out as someth smaller than inch by inch and not specifi by standards, and after dri and plane is reliabl by inch mm \u00d7 mm). as previous noted, less wood is need to produc a given finish size than when standard call for the green lumber to be the full nomin dimension. however, even the dimens for finish lumber of a given nomin size have chang over time. in a typic finish mm) board was in mm). in that was reduc by and yet again by in in at a meet in scottsdale, arizona, the committe on grade simplif and standard agre to what is now the current u.s. standard: in part, the dress size of a (nominal) board was fix at inch; while the dress size of inch (nominal) lumber was reduc from inch to the current inch.dimension lumber is avail in green, unfinish state, and for that kind of lumber, the nomin dimens are the actual dimensions. === grade and standard === individu piec of lumber exhibit a wide rang in qualiti and appear with respect to knots, slope of grain, shake and other natur characteristics. therefore, they vari consider in strength, utility, and value. the move to set nation standard for lumber in the unit state began with the public of the american lumber standard in which set specif for lumber dimensions, grade, and moistur content; it also develop inspect and accredit programs. these standard have chang over the year to meet the chang need of manufactur and distributors, with the goal of keep lumber competit with other construct products. current standard are set by the american lumber standard committee, appoint by the u.s. secretari of commerce.design valu for most speci and grade of visual grade structur product are determin in accord with astm standards, which consid the effect of strength reduc characteristics, load duration, safety, and other influenc factors. the applic standard are base on result of test conduct in cooper with the usda forest product laboratory. design valu for wood construction, which is a supplement to the ansi/af&pa nation design specification\u00ae for wood construction, provid these lumber design values, which are recogn by the model build codes.canada has grade rule that maintain a standard among mill manufactur similar wood to assur custom of uniform quality. grade standard the qualiti of lumber at differ level and are base on moistur content, size, and manufactur at the time of grading, shipping, and unload by the buyer. the nation lumber grade author (nlga) is respons for writing, interpret and maintain canadian lumber grade rule and standards. the canadian lumber standard accredit board (clsab) monitor the qualiti of canada lumber grade and identif system. attempt to maintain lumber qualiti over time have been challeng by histor chang in the timber resourc of the unit state \u2013 from the slow-grow virgin forest common over a centuri ago to the fast-grow plantat now common in today commerci forests. result declin in lumber qualiti have been of concern to both the lumber industri and consum and have caus increas use of altern construct products.machin stress-rat and machine-evalu lumber are readili avail for end-us where high strength is critical, such as trusses, rafters, lamin stock, i-beam and web joints. machin grade measur a characterist such as stiff or densiti that correl with the structur properti of interest, such as bend strength. the result is a more precis understand of the strength of each piec of lumber than is possibl with visual grade lumber, which allow design to use full-design strength and avoid overbuilding.in europe, strength grade of rectangular sawn timber (both softwood and hardwood) is done accord to and common sort into class defin by for softwoods, the common class are (in increas strength) and there are also class specif for hardwood and those in most common use (in increas strength) are and for these classes, the number refer to the requir percentil bend strength in newton per squar millimetre. there are other strength classes, includ t-class base on tension intend for use in glulam. use for scaffold and formwork and general construct prefab roof truss and where design requir somewhat stronger joist than can offer. is also a common truss rafter strength class in long stand use in the uk. usual seen in glulamgrad rule for african and south american sawn timber have been develop by atibt accord to the rule of the sciag aviv\u00e9 tropicaux africain (sata) and is base on clear cut \u2013 establish by the percentag of the clear surface. === north american hardwood === in north america, market practic for dimension lumber made from hardwood vari signific from the regular standard dimens lumber size use for sale and specif of softwood \u2013 hardwood board are often sold total rough cut, or machin plane onli on the two (broader) face sides. when hardwood board are also suppli with plane faces, it is usual both by random width of a specifi thick (normal match mill of softwood dimension lumbers) and somewhat random lengths. but besid those older (tradit and normal) situations, in recent year some product line have been widen to also market board in standard stock sizes; these usual retail in big-box store and use onli a relat small set of specifi lengths; in all case hardwood are sold to the consum by the board-foot cubic inch or cubic centimetres), wherea that measur is not use for softwood at the retail (to the cogniz of the buyer). also in north america, hardwood lumber is common sold in a \"quarter\" system, when refer to thickness; (four quarter) refer to a mm) board, (eight quarter) is a mm) board, etc. this \"quarter\" system is rare use for softwood lumber; although softwood deck is sometim sold as even though it is actual one-inch thick (from mill in or mm off each side in a motor plane step of production). the \"quarter\" system of refer is a tradit north american lumber industri nomenclatur use specif to indic the thick of rough sawn hardwood lumber. in rough-sawn lumber it immedi clarifi that the lumber is not yet milled, avoid confus with mill dimens lumber which is measur as actual thick after machining. exampl \u2013 mm, or in recent year architects, designers, and builder have begun to use the \"quarter\" system in specif as a vogu of insid knowledge, though the materi be specifi are finish lumber, thus conflat the separ system and caus confusion. hardwood cut for furnitur are cut in the fall and winter, after the sap has stop run in the trees. if hardwood are cut in the spring or summer the sap ruin the natur color of the timber and decreas the valu of the timber for furniture. === engin lumber === engin lumber is lumber creat by a manufactur and design for a certain structur purpose. the main categori of engin lumber are: lamin veneer lumber (lvl) \u2013 lvl come in inch thick with depth such as and inches, and are often doubl or tripl up. they function as beam to provid support over larg spans, such as remov support wall and garag door openings, place where dimension lumber is insufficient, and also in area where a heavi load is bear from a floor, wall or roof abov on a somewhat short span where dimension lumber is impractical. this type of lumber is compromis if it is alter by hole or notch anywher within the span or at the ends, but nail can be driven into it wherev necessari to anchor the beam or to add hanger for i-joist or dimension lumber joist that termin at an lvl beam. wooden i-joist \u2013 sometim call \"tji\", \"trus joists\" or \"bci\", all of which are brand of wooden i-joists, they are use for floor joist on upper floor and also in first floor convent foundat construct on pier as oppos to slab floor construction. they are engin for long span and are doubl up in place where a wall will be align over them, and sometim tripl where heavi roof-load support wall are place abov them. they consist of a top and bottom chord or flang made from dimension lumber with a web in-between made from orient strand board (osb) (or, latterly, steel mesh form which allow passag of servic without cutting). the web can be remov up to certain size or shape accord to the manufactur or engin specifications, but for small holes, wooden i-joist come with \"knockouts\", which are perforated, pre-cut area where hole can be made easily, typic without engin approval. when larg hole are needed, they can typic be made in the web onli and onli in the center third of the span; the top and bottom chord lose their integr if cut. size and shape of the hole, and typic the place of a hole itself, must be approv by an engin prior to the cut of the hole and in mani areas, a sheet show the calcul made by the engin must be provid to the build inspect author befor the hole will be approved. some i-joist are made with w-style web like a truss to elimin cut and to allow ductwork to pass through. finger-joint lumber \u2013 solid dimension lumber length typic are limit to length of to feet, but can be made longer by the techniqu of \"finger-jointing\" by use small solid pieces, usual to inch long, and join them togeth use finger joint and glue to produc length that can be up to feet long in size. finger-joint also is predomin in precut wall studs. it is also an afford altern for non-structur hardwood that will be paint (stain would leav the finger-joint visible). care is taken dure construct to avoid nail direct into a glu joint as stud breakag can occur. glulam beam \u2013 creat from or stock by glu the face togeth to creat beam such as or as such, a beam act as one larger piec of lumber \u2013 thus elimin the need to harvest larger, older tree for the same size beam. manufactur truss \u2013 truss are use in home construct as a pre-fabr replac for roof rafter and ceil joist (stick-framing). it is seen as an easier instal and a better solut for support roof than the use of dimension lumber strut and purlin as bracing. in the southern u.s. and elsewhere, stick-fram with dimension lumber roof support is still predominant. the main drawback of truss are reduc attic space, time requir for engin and ordering, and a cost higher than the dimension lumber need if the same project were convent framed. the advantag are signific reduc labor cost (instal is faster than convent framing), consistency, and overal schedul savings. === various piec and cut === squar and rectangular forms: plank, slat, batten, board, lath, strap (typic in \u00d7 in), cant (a partial sawn log such as sawn on two side or squar to a larg size and later resawn into lumber. a flitch is a type of cant with wane on one or both sides). various piec are also known by their use such as post, beam, (girt), stud, rafter, joist, sill plate, wall plate. rod forms: pole, (dowel), stick (staff, baton) === timber pile === in the unit states, pile are main cut from southern yellow pine and dougla firs. treat pile are avail in chromat copper arsenat retent of and pound per cubic foot and if treatment is required. === histor chines construct === under the prescript of the method of construct (\u71df\u9020\u6cd5\u5f0f) issu by the song dynasti govern in the earli century, timber were standard to eight cross-sect dimensions. regardless of the actual dimens of the timber, the ratio between width and height was maintain at unit are in song dynasti inch mm). timber smaller than the class were call \"unclassed\" (\u7b49\u5916). the width of a timber is refer to as one \"timber\" (\u6750), and the dimens of other structur compon were quot in multipl of \"timber\"; thus, as the width of the actual timber varied, the dimens of other compon were easili calculated, without resort to specif figur for each scale. the dimens of timber in similar applic show a gradual diminut from the sui dyansti to the modern era; a class timber dure the sui was reconstruct as (sui dynasti inches, or mm). == defect in lumber == defect occur in lumber are group into the follow four divisions: === convers === dure the process of convert timber to commerci form the follow defect may occur: chip mark: this defect is indic by the mark or sign place by chip on the finish surfac of timber diagon grain: improp saw of timber torn grain: when a small dent is made on the finish surfac due to fall of some tool wane: presenc of origin round surfac in the finish product === defect due to fungi and anim === fungi attack timber when these condit are all present: the timber moistur content is abov on a dry-weight basi the environ is suffici warm oxygen is presentwood with less than moistur (dri weight basis) can remain free of decay for centuries. similarly, wood submerg in water may not be attack by fungi if the amount of oxygen is inadequate. fungi timber defects: blue stain brown rot dri rot heart rot sap stain wet rot white rotfollow are the insect and mollusc which are usual respons for the decay of timber: woodbor beetl marin borer (barnea similis) teredo (teredo navalis) termit carpent ant carpent bee === natur forc === there are two main natur forc respons for caus defect in timber: abnorm growth and ruptur of tissues. ruptur of tissu includ crack or split in the wood call \"shakes\". \"ring shake\", \"wind shake\", or \"ring failure\" is when the wood grain separ around the growth ring either while stand or dure felling. shake may reduc the strength of a timber and the appear thus reduc lumber grade and may captur moisture, promot decay. eastern hemlock is known for have ring shake. a \"check\" is a crack on the surfac of the wood caus by the outsid of a timber shrink as it seasons. check may extend to the pith and follow the grain. like shakes, check can hold water promot rot. a \"split\" goe all the way through a timber. check and split occur more frequent at the end of lumber becaus of the more rapid dri in these locations. === season === the season of lumber is typic either kiln- or air-dried. defect due to season are the main caus of splits, bow and honeycombing. == durabl and servic life == under proper conditions, wood provid excellent, last performance. however, it also face sever potenti threat to servic life, includ fungal activ and insect damag \u2013 which can be avoid in numer ways. section of the intern build code address protect against decay and termites. this section provid requir for non-residenti construct applications, such as wood use abov ground (e.g., for framing, decks, stairs, etc.), as well as other applications. there are four recommend method to protect wood-fram structur against durabl hazard and thus provid maximum servic life for the building. all requir proper design and construction: control moistur use design techniqu to avoid decay provid effect control of termit and other insect use durabl materi such as pressure-tr or natur durabl speci of wood where appropri provid qualiti assur dure design and construct and throughout the build servic life use appropri mainten practic === moistur control === wood is a hygroscop material, which mean it natur absorb and releas water to balanc it intern moistur content with the surround environment. the moistur content of wood is measur by the weight of water as a percentag of the oven-dri weight of the wood fiber. the key to control decay is control moisture. onc decay fungi are established, the minimum moistur content for decay to propag is to percent, so build expert recommend percent as the maximum safe moistur content for untreat wood in service. water by itself doe not harm the wood, but rather, wood with consist high moistur content enabl fungal organ to grow. the primari object when address moistur load is to keep water from enter the build envelop in the first place and to balanc the moistur content within the build itself. moistur control by mean of accept design and construct detail is a simpl and practic method of protect a wood-fram build against decay. for applic with a high risk of stay wet, design specifi durabl materi such as natur decay-resist speci or wood that has been treat with preservatives. cladding, shingles, sill plate and expos timber or glulam beam are exampl of potenti applic for treat wood. === control termit and other insect === for build in termit zones, basic protect practic address in current build code includ (but are not limit to) the following: grade the build site away from the foundat to provid proper drainag cover expos ground in ani crawl space with polyethylen film and maintain at least to inch to mm) of clearanc between the ground and the bottom of frame member abov inch to beam or girders, inch to joist or plank floor members) support post column by concret pier so that there is at least inch mm) of clear space between the wood and expos earth instal wood frame and sheath in exterior wall at least eight inch abov expos earth; locat side at least six inch from the finish grade where appropriate, ventil crawl space accord to local build code remov build materi scrap from the job site befor backfilling. if allow by local regulation, treat the soil around the foundat with an approv termiticid to provid protect against subterranean termit === preserv === to avoid decay and termit infestation, untreat wood is separ from the ground and other sourc of moisture. these separ are requir by mani build code and are consid necessari to maintain wood element in perman structur at a safe moistur content for decay protection. when it is not possibl to separ wood from the sourc of moisture, design often reli on preservative-tr wood.wood can be treat with a preserv that improv servic life under sever condit without alter it basic characteristics. it can also be pressure-impregn with fire-retard chemic that improv it perform in a fire. one of the earli treatment to \"fireproof lumber\", which retard fires, was develop in by the protexol corporation, in which lumber is heavili treat with salt. wood doe not deterior simpli becaus it get wet. when wood break down, it is becaus an organ is eat it. preserv work by make the food sourc ined to these organisms. proper preservative-tr wood can have to time the servic life of untreat wood. preserv wood is use most often for railroad ties, util poles, marin piles, decks, fenc and other outdoor applications. various treatment method and type of chemic are available, depend on the attribut requir in the particular applic and the level of protect needed.ther are two basic method of treating: with and without pressure. non-pressur method are the applic of preserv by brushing, spraying, or dip the piec to be treated. deeper, more thorough penetr is achiev by drive the preserv into the wood cell with pressure. various combin of pressur and vacuum are use to forc adequ level of chemic into the wood. pressure-tr preserv consist of chemic carri in a solvent. chromat copper arsenate, onc the most common use wood preserv in north america

the legal ton was usual lb. assay ton (abbrevi at') is not a unit of measur but a standard quantiti use in assay ore of precious metals. a short assay ton is gram while a long assay ton is gram. these amount bear the same ratio to a milligram as a short or long ton bear to a troy ounce. therefore, the number of milligram of a particular metal found in a sampl weigh one assay ton give the number of troy ounc of metal contain in a ton of ore. in document that predat the word ton is sometim spell tonne, but in more recent document tonn refer exclus to the metric ton. in nuclear power plant thm and mthm mean tonn of heavi metals, and mtu mean tonn of uranium. in the steel industry, the abbrevi thm mean tons/tonn hot metal', which refer to the amount of liquid iron or steel that is produced, particular in the context of blast furnac product or specif consumption. a dri ton or dri tonn has the same mass value, but the materi (sludge, slurries, compost, and similar mixtur in which solid materi is soak with or suspend in water) has been dri to a relat low, consist moistur level (dri weight). if the materi is in it natural, wet state, it is call a wet ton or wet tonne. === subdivis === in the imperi unit system, the imperi (long) ton is equival to hundredweight, a hundredweight be eight stone, and a stone weigh pounds. == unit of volum == the displacement, essenti the weight, of a ship is tradit express in long tons. to simplifi measur it is determin by measur the volume, rather than weight, of water displaced, and calcul the weight from the volum and density. for practic purpos the displac ton (dt) is a unit of volume, cubic feet the approxim volum occupi by one ton of seawat (the actual volum vari with salin and temperature). it is slight less than the imperi gallon of the water ton (base on distil water). one measur ton or freight ton is equal to cubic feet but histor it has had sever differ definitions. it is use to determin the amount of money to be charg in loading, unloading, or carri differ sort of cargo. in general if a cargo is heavier than salt water, the actual tonnag is used. if it is lighter than salt water, e.g. feathers, freight is calcul use measur ton of cubic feet.gross tonnag and net tonnag are volumetr measur of the cargo-carri capac of a ship. the panama canal/univers measur system (pc/ums) is base on net tonnage, modifi for panama canal bill purposes. pc/um is base on a mathemat formula to calcul a vessel total volume; a pc/um net ton is equival to cubic feet of capacity.th water ton is use chiefli in great britain, in statist deal with petroleum products, and is defin as imperi gallon cu ft; the volum occupi by long ton lb; kg) of water under the condit that defin the imperi gallon. == unit of energi and power == === ton of tnt === a ton of tnt or tonn of tnt is a unit of energi equal to (thermochemical) calories, also known as a gigacalori (gcal), equal to gigajoul (gj). a kiloton of tnt or kilotonn of tnt is a unit of energi equal to calories, also known as a teracalori (tcal), equal to terajoul (tj). a megaton of tnt metric tonnes) or megatonn of tnt is a unit of energi equal to calories, also known (infrequently) as a petacalori (pcal), equal to petajoul (pj).note that these are small calori (cal). the larg or dietari calori (cal) is equal to one kilocalori (kcal), and is gradual be replac by the latter correct term. earli valu for the explos energi releas by trinitrotoluen (tnt) rang from to calori per gram. in order to standardis the use of the term tnt as a unit of energy, an arbitrari valu was assign base on calori kcal or kj) per gram. thus there is no longer a direct connect to the chemic tnt itself. it is now mere a unit of energi that happen to be express use word normal associ with mass (e.g., kilogram, tonne, pound). the definit appli for both spellings: ton of tnt and tonn of tnt. measur in ton of tnt have been use primarili to express nuclear weapon yields, though they have also been use sinc in seismolog as well. === tonn of oil equival === a tonn of oil equival (toe), sometim ton of oil equivalent, is a convent value, base on the amount of energi releas by burn one tonn of crude oil. the unit is used, for example, by the intern energi agenc (iea), for the report world energi consumpt as tpes in million of toe (mtoe). other sourc convert toe into tonn of coal equival (tce). toe is also standard as barrel of oil equival (boe). === tonn of coal equival === a tonn of coal equival (tce), sometim ton of coal equivalent, is a convent value, base on the amount of energi releas by burn one tonn of coal. plural name is tonn of coal equivalent. per the world coal association: tonn of coal equival (tce) correspond to tonn of oil equival (toe) per the intern energi agenc tonn of coal equival (tce) correspond to tonn of oil equival (toe) === refriger === the unit ton is use in refriger and air condit to measur the rate of heat absorption. prior to the introduct of mechan refrigeration, cool was accomplish by deliv ice. instal one ton of mechan refriger capac replac the daili deliveri of one ton of ice. in north america, a standard ton of refriger is btu/h w). \"the heat absorpt per day is approxim the heat of fusion of ton of ice at \u00b0f \u00b0c).\" this is approxim the power requir to melt one short ton lb or kg) of ice at \u00b0c \u00b0f) in hours, thus repres the deliveri of short ton long tons; t) of ice per day. a less common usag is the power requir to cool long ton lb or kg = long ton or short ton or t) of water by \u00b0f \u00b0c) everi minut = btu/h w).the refriger ton is common abbrevi as rt. == inform ton == ton is also use informally, often as slang, to mean a larg amount of something, materi or not. for example, \"i have a ton of homework to do this weekend.\" in britain, a ton is colloqui use to refer to of a given unit. ton can thus refer to a speed of mile per hour, and is prefix by an indefinit article, e.g. \"lee was do a ton down the motorway\"; to money e.g. \"how much did you pay for that?\" \"a ton\" to point in a game e.g. \"eric just threw a ton in our dart game\" (in some games, e.g. cricket, more common call a century); or to a hundr of ani other countabl figure. in dutch, when talk about money a ton is use to indic for exampl a hous cost ton would cost euros. this convent has been in use sinc at least the century. in finnish, tonni is often use as a synonym for especi when refer to money. for example, tonnin sete was a banknote, and a popular tv show was call kymppitonni (\"ten tons\" = marks). == see also == == refer ==",

    "in physic energi is the quantit properti that must be transfer to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object energi is a conserv quantiti the law of conserv of energi state that

object s total mass just as it increas it total energi for exampl after heat an object it increas in energi could be measur as a small increas in mass, with a sensit enough scale. live organ requir energi to stay alive, such as the energi human get from food. human civil requir energi to function, which it get from energi resourc such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renew energy. the process of earth climat and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energi earth receiv from the sun and the geotherm energi contain within the earth. == form == the total energi of a system can be subdivid and classifi into potenti energy, kinet energy, or combin of the two in various ways. kinet energi is determin by the movement of an object \u2013 or the composit motion of the compon of an object \u2013 and potenti energi reflect the potenti of an object to have motion, and general is a function of the posit of an object within a field or may be store in the field itself. while these two categori are suffici to describ all form of energy, it is often conveni to refer to particular combin of potenti and kinet energi as it own form. for example, macroscop mechan energi is the sum of translat and rotat kinet and potenti energi in a system neglect the kinet energi due to temperature, and nuclear energi which combin potenti from the nuclear forc and the weak force), among others. == histori == the word energi deriv from the ancient greek: \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, romanized: energeia, lit. activity, operation', which possibl appear for the first time in the work of aristotl in the centuri bc. in contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualit philosoph concept, broad enough to includ idea such as happi and pleasure. in the late century, gottfri leibniz propos the idea of the latin: vis viva, or live force, which defin as the product of the mass of an object and it veloc squared; he believ that total vis viva was conserved. to account for slow due to friction, leibniz theoriz that thermal energi consist of the random motion of the constitu part of matter, although it would be more than a centuri until this was general accepted. the modern analog of this property, kinet energy, differ from vis viva onli by a factor of two. in thoma young was possibl the first to use the term \"energy\" instead of vis viva, in it modern sense. gustave-gaspard corioli describ \"kinet energy\" in in it modern sense, and in william rankin coin the term \"potenti energy\". the law of conserv of energi was also first postul in the earli century, and appli to ani isol system. it was argu for some year whether heat was a physic substance, dub the caloric, or mere a physic quantity, such as momentum. in jame prescott joul discov the link between mechan work and the generat of heat. these develop led to the theori of conserv of energy, formal larg by william thomson (lord kelvin) as the field of thermodynamics. thermodynam aid the rapid develop of explan of chemic process by rudolf clausius, josiah willard gibbs, and walther nernst. it also led to a mathemat formul of the concept of entropi by clausius and to the introduct of law of radiant energi by jo\u017eef stefan. accord to noether theorem, the conserv of energi is a consequ of the fact that the law of physic do not chang over time. thus, sinc theorist have understood that the law of conserv of energi is the direct mathemat consequ of the translat symmetri of the quantiti conjug to energy, name time. == unit of measur == in jame prescott joul independ discov the mechan equival in a seri of experiments. the most famous of them use the \"joul apparatus\": a descend weight, attach to a string, caus rotat of a paddl immers in water, practic insul from heat transfer. it show that the gravit potenti energi lost by the weight in descend was equal to the intern energi gain by the water through friction with the paddle. in the intern system of unit (si), the unit of energi is the joule, name after joule. it is a deriv unit. it is equal to the energi expend (or work done) in appli a forc of one newton through a distanc of one metre. howev energi is also express in mani other unit not part of the si, such as ergs, calories, british thermal units, kilowatt-hour and kilocalories, which requir a convers factor when express in si units. the si unit of energi rate (energi per unit time) is the watt, which is a joul per second. thus, one joul is one watt-second, and joul equal one watt-hour. the cgs energi unit is the erg and the imperi and us customari unit is the foot pound. other energi unit such as the electronvolt, food calori or thermodynam kcal (base on the temperatur chang of water in a heat process), and btu are use in specif area of scienc and commerce. == scientif use == === classic mechan === in classic mechanics, energi is a conceptu and mathemat use property, as it is a conserv quantity. sever formul of mechan have been develop use energi as a core concept. work, a function of energy, is forc time distance. w = \u222b c f \u22c5 d s {\\displaystyl w=\\int _{c}\\mathbf {f} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {s} } this say that the work ( w {\\displaystyl w} ) is equal to the line integr of the forc f along a path c; for detail see the mechan work article. work and thus energi is frame dependent. for example, consid a ball be hit by a bat. in the center-of-mass refer frame, the bat doe no work on the ball. but, in the refer frame of the person swing the bat, consider work is done on the ball. the total energi of a system is sometim call the hamiltonian, after william rowan hamilton. the classic equat of motion can be written in term of the hamiltonian, even for high complex or abstract systems. these classic equat have remark direct analog in nonrelativist quantum mechanics.anoth energy-rel concept is call the lagrangian, after joseph-loui lagrange. this formal is as fundament as the hamiltonian, and both can be use to deriv the equat of motion or be deriv from them. it was invent in the context of classic mechanics, but is general use in modern physics. the lagrangian is defin as the kinet energi minus the potenti energy. usually, the lagrang formal is mathemat more conveni than the hamiltonian for non-conserv system (such as system with friction). noether theorem state that ani differenti symmetri of the action of a physic system has a correspond conserv law. noether theorem has becom a fundament tool of modern theoret physic and the calculus of variations. a generalis of the semin formul on constant of motion in lagrangian and hamiltonian mechan and respectively), it doe not appli to system that cannot be model with a lagrangian; for example, dissip system with continu symmetri need not have a

accompani by a chang in one or more of these kind of structure, it is invari accompani by an increas or decreas of energi of the substanc involved. some energi is transfer between the surround and the reactant of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the product of a reaction may have more or less energi than the reactants. a reaction is said to be exotherm or exergon if the final state is lower on the energi scale than the initi state; in the case of endotherm reaction the situat is the reverse. chemic reaction are usual not possibl unless the reactant surmount an energi barrier known as the activ energy. the speed of a chemic reaction (at given temperatur t) is relat to the activ energi e by the boltzmann popul factor e\u2212e/kt \u2013 that is the probabl of molecul to have energi greater than or equal to e at the given temperatur t. this exponenti depend of a reaction rate on temperatur is known as the arrhenius equation. the activ energi necessari for a chemic reaction can be provid in the form of thermal energy. === biolog === in biology, energi is an attribut of all biolog system from the biospher to the smallest live organism. within an organ it is respons for growth and develop of a biolog cell or an organell of a biolog organism. energi use in respir is most store in molecular oxygen and can be unlock by reaction with molecul of substanc such as carbohydr (includ sugars), lipids, and protein store by cells. in human terms, the human equival (h-e) (human energi conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energi expenditure, the relat quantiti of energi need for human metabolism, assum an averag human energi expenditur of kj per day and a basal metabol rate of watts. for example, if our bodi run (on average) at watts, then a light bulb run at watt is run at human equival \u00f7 i.e. h-e. for a difficult task of onli a few second duration, a person can put out thousand of watts, mani time the watt in one offici horsepower. for task last a few minutes, a fit human can generat perhap watts. for an activ that must be sustain for an hour, output drop to around for an activ kept up all day, watt is about the maximum. the human equival assist understand of energi flow in physic and biolog system by express energi unit in human terms: it provid a \"feel\" for the use of a given amount of energy.sunlight radiant energi is also captur by plant as chemic potenti energi in photosynthesis, when carbon dioxid and water (two low-energi compounds) are convert into carbohydrates, lipids, and protein and high-energi compound like oxygen and atp. carbohydrates, lipids, and protein can releas the energi of oxygen, which is util by live organ as an electron acceptor. releas of the energi store dure photosynthesi as heat or light may be trigger sudden by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made avail more slowli for anim or human metabolism, when organ molecul are ingested, and catabol is trigger by enzym action. ani live organ reli on an extern sourc of energi \u2013 radiant energi from the sun in the case of green plants, chemic energi in some form in the case of anim \u2013 to be abl to grow and reproduce. the daili calori mj) recommend for a human adult are taken as a combin of oxygen and food molecules, the latter most carbohydr and fats, of which glucos and stearin are conveni examples. the food molecul are oxidis to carbon dioxid and water in the mitochondria c h o + o \u27f6 co + h o {\\displaystyl {\\ce + -> + c h o + \u22c5 o \u27f6 co + h o {\\displaystyl {\\ce + -> + and some of the energi is use to convert adp into atp. adp + \u2192 atp + rest of the chemic energi in and the carbohydr or fat is convert into heat: the atp is use as a sort of \"energi currency\", and some of the chemic energi it contain is use for other metabol when atp react with oh group and eventu split into adp and phosphat (at each stage of a metabol pathway, some chemic energi is convert into heat). onli a tini fraction of the origin chemic energi is use for work: gain in kinet energi of a sprinter dure a m race: kj gain in gravit potenti energi of a kg weight lift through metres: kj daili food intak of a normal adult: mjit would appear that live organ are remark ineffici (in the physic sense) in their use of the energi they receiv (chemic or radiant energy), and it is true that most real machin manag higher efficiencies. in grow organ the energi that is convert to heat serv a vital purpose, as it allow the organ tissu to be high order with regard to the molecul it is built from. the second law of thermodynam state that energi (and matter) tend to becom more even spread out across the universe: to concentr energi (or matter) in one specif place, it is necessari to spread out a greater amount of energi (as heat) across the remaind of the univers (\"the surroundings\"). simpler organ can achiev higher energi effici than more complex ones, but the complex organ can occupi ecolog nich that are not avail to their simpler brethren. the convers of a portion of the chemic energi to heat at each step in a metabol pathway is the physic reason behind the pyramid of biomass observ in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estim pg/a of carbon that is fix by photosynthesis, pg/a are use for the metabol of green plants, i.e. reconvert into carbon dioxid and heat. === earth scienc === in geology, continent drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquak are phenomena that can be explain in term of energi transform in the earth interior, while meteorolog phenomena like wind, rain, hail, snow, lightning, tornado and hurrican are all a result of energi transform brought about by solar energi on the atmospher of the planet earth. sunlight may be store as gravit potenti energi after it strike the earth, as (for example) water evapor from ocean and is deposit upon mountain (where, after be releas at a hydroelectr dam, it can be use to drive turbin or generat to produc electricity). sunlight also drive mani weather phenomena, save those generat by volcan events. an exampl of a solar-medi weather event is a hurricane, which occur when larg unstabl area of warm ocean, heat over months, give up some of their thermal energi sudden to power a few day of violent air movement. in a slower process, radioact decay of atom in the core of the earth releas heat. this thermal energi drive plate tecton and may lift mountains, via orogenesis. this slow lift repres a kind of gravit potenti energi storag of the thermal energy, which may be later releas to activ kinet energi in landslides, after a trigger event. earthquak also releas store elast potenti energi in rocks, a store that has been produc ultim from the same radioact heat sources. thus, accord to present understanding, familiar event such as landslid and earthquak releas energi that has been store as potenti energi in the earth gravit field or elast strain (mechan potenti energy) in rocks. prior to this, they repres releas of energi that has been store in heavi atom sinc the collaps of long-destroy supernova star creat these atoms. === cosmolog === in cosmolog and astronomi the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasar and gamma-ray burst are the univers highest-output energi transform of matter. all stellar phenomena (includ solar activity) are driven by various kind of energi transformations. energi in such transform is either from gravit collaps of matter (usual molecular hydrogen) into various class of astronom object (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarili hydrogen). the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the sun also releas anoth store of potenti energi which was creat at the time of the big bang. at that time, accord to theory, space expand and the univers cool too rapid for hydrogen to complet fuse into heavier elements. this meant that hydrogen repres a store of potenti energi that can be releas by fusion. such a fusion process is trigger by heat and pressur generat from gravit collaps of hydrogen cloud when they produc stars, and some of the fusion energi is then transform into sunlight. === quantum mechan === in quantum mechanics, energi is defin in term of the energi oper as a time deriv of the wave function. the schr\u00f6dinger equat equat the energi oper to the full energi of a particl or a system. it result can be consid as a definit of measur of energi in quantum mechanics. the schr\u00f6dinger equat describ the space- and time-depend of a slowli chang (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. the solut of this equat for a bound system is discret (a set of permit states, each character by an energi level) which result in the concept of quanta. in the solut of the schr\u00f6dinger equat for ani oscil (vibrator) and for electromagnet wave in a vacuum, the result energi state are relat to the frequenc by planck relation: e = h \u03bd {\\displaystyl e=h\\nu } (where h {\\displaystyl h} is planck constant and \u03bd {\\displaystyl \\nu } the frequency). in the case of an electromagnet wave these energi state are call quanta of light or photons. === relat === when calcul kinet energi (work to acceler a massiv bodi from zero speed to some finit speed) relativist \u2013 use lorentz transform instead of newtonian mechan \u2013 einstein discov an unexpect by-product of these calcul to be an energi term which doe not vanish at zero speed. he call it rest energy: energi which everi massiv bodi must possess even when be at rest. the amount of energi is direct proport to the mass of the body: e = m c {\\displaystyl ,where m is the mass of the body, c is the speed of light in vacuum, e {\\displaystyl is the rest energy.for example, consid electron\u2013positron annihilation, in which the rest energi of these two individu particl (equival to their rest mass) is convert to the radiant energi of the photon produc in the process. in this system the matter and antimatt (electron and positrons) are destroy and chang to non-matt (the photons). however, the total mass and total energi do not chang dure this interaction. the photon each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energi which exhibit the same inertia as did the two origin particles. this is a revers process \u2013 the invers process is call pair creation \u2013 in which the rest mass of particl is creat from the radiant energi of two (or more) annihil photons. in general relativity, the stress\u2013energi tensor serv as the sourc term for the gravit field, in rough analog to the way mass serv as the sourc term in the non-relativist newtonian approximation.energi and mass are manifest of one and the same under physic properti of a system. this properti is respons for the inertia and strength of gravit interact of the system (\"mass manifestations\"), and is also respons for the potenti abil of the system to perform work or heat (\"energi manifestations\"), subject to the limit of other physic laws. in classic physics, energi is a scalar quantity, the canon conjug to time. in special relat energi is also a scalar (although not a lorentz scalar but a time compon of the energy\u2013momentum in other words, energi is invari with respect to rotat of space, but not invari with respect to rotat of spacetim (= boosts). == transform == energi may be transform between differ form at various efficiencies. item that transform between these form are call transducers. exampl of transduc includ a battery, from chemic energi to electr energy; a dam: gravit potenti energi to kinet energi of move water (and the blade of a turbine) and ultim to electr energi through an electr generator; or a heat engine, from heat to work. exampl of energi transform includ generat electr energi from heat energi via a steam turbine, or lift an object against graviti use electr energi drive a crane motor. lift against graviti perform mechan work on the object and store gravit potenti energi in the object. if the object fall to the ground, graviti doe mechan work on the object which transform the potenti energi in the gravit field to the kinet energi releas as heat on impact with the ground. our sun transform nuclear potenti energi to other form of energy; it total mass doe not decreas due to that in itself (sinc it still contain the same total energi even if in differ forms), but it mass doe decreas when the energi escap out to it surroundings, larg as radiant energy. there are strict limit to how effici heat can be convert into work in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as describ by carnot theorem and the second law of thermodynamics. however, some energi transform can be quit efficient. the direct of transform in energi (what kind of energi is transform to what other kind) is often determin by entropi (equal energi spread among all avail degre of freedom) considerations. in practic all energi transform are permit on a small scale, but certain larger transform are not permit becaus it is statist unlik that energi or matter will random move into more concentr form or smaller spaces. energi transform in the univers over time are character by various kind of potenti energi that has been avail sinc the big bang later be \"released\" (transform to more activ type of energi such as kinet or radiant energy) when a trigger mechan is available. familiar exampl of such process includ nuclear decay, in which energi is releas that was origin \"stored\" in heavi isotop (such as uranium and thorium), by nucleosynthesis, a process ultim use the gravit potenti energi releas from the gravit collaps of supernovae, to store energi in the creation of these heavi element befor they were incorpor into the solar system and the earth. this energi is trigger and releas in nuclear fission bomb or in civil nuclear power generation. similarly, in the case of a chemic explosion, chemic potenti energi is transform to kinet energi and thermal energi in a veri short time. yet anoth exampl is that of a pendulum. at it highest point the kinet energi is zero and the gravit potenti energi is at maximum. at it lowest point the kinet energi is at maximum and is equal to the decreas of potenti energy. if one (unrealistically) assum that there is no friction or other losses, the convers of energi between these process would be perfect, and the pendulum would continu swing forever. energi is also transfer from potenti energi ( e p {\\displaystyl e_{p}} ) to kinet energi ( e k {\\displaystyl e_{k}} ) and then back to potenti energi constantly. this is refer to as conserv of energy. in this close system, energi cannot be creat or destroyed; therefore, the initi energi and the final energi will be equal to each other. this can be demonstr by the following: the equat can then be simplifi further sinc e p = m g h {\\displaystyl e_{p}=mgh} (mass time acceler due to graviti time the height) and e k = m v {\\displaystyl e_{k}={\\frac (half mass time veloc squared). then the total amount of energi can be found by ad e p + e k = e t o t a l {\\displaystyl e_{p}+e_{k}=e_{total}} . === conserv of energi and mass in transform === energi give rise to weight when it is trap in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. it is also equival to mass, and this mass is alway associ with it. mass is also equival to a certain amount of energy, and likewis alway appear associ with it, as describ in mass-energi equivalence. the formula e = mc\u00b2, deriv by albert einstein quantifi the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energi within the concept of special relativity. in differ theoret frameworks, similar formula were deriv by j.j. thomson henri poincar\u00e9 friedrich hasen\u00f6hrl and other (see mass-energi equivalence#histori for further information). part of the rest energi (equival to rest mass) of matter may be convert to other form of energi (still exhibit mass), but neither energi nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant dure ani process. however, sinc c {\\displaystyl is extrem larg relat to ordinari human scales, the convers of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, kg) from rest energi to other form of energi (such as kinet energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energi carri by light and other radiation) can liber tremend amount of energi (~ \u00d7 {\\displaystyl joul = megaton of tnt), as can be seen in nuclear reactor and nuclear weapons. conversely, the mass equival of an everyday amount energi is minuscule, which is whi a loss of energi (loss of mass) from most system is difficult to measur on a weigh scale, unless the energi loss is veri large. exampl of larg transform between rest energi (of matter) and other form of energi (e.g., kinet energi into particl with rest mass) are found in nuclear physic and particl physics. === revers and non-revers transform === thermodynam divid energi transform into two kinds: revers process and irrevers processes. an irrevers process is one in which energi is dissip (spread) into empti energi state avail in a volume, from which it cannot be recov into more concentr form (fewer quantum states), without degrad of even more energy. a revers process is one in which this sort of dissip doe not happen. for example, convers of energi from one type of potenti field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system describ above. in process where heat is generated, quantum state of lower energy, present as possibl excit in field between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be convert with effici into other form of energy. in this case, the energi must part stay as heat, and cannot be complet recov as usabl energy, except at the price of an increas in some other kind of heat-lik increas in disord in quantum states, in the univers (such as an expans of matter, or a randomis in a crystal). as the univers evolv in time, more and more of it energi becom trap in irrevers state (i.e., as heat or other kind of increas in disorder). this has been refer to as the inevit thermodynam heat death of the universe. in this heat death the energi of the univers doe not change, but the fraction of energi which is avail to do work through a heat engine, or be transform to other usabl form of energi (through the use of generat attach to heat engines), grow less and less. == conserv of energi == the fact that energi can be neither creat nor be destroy is call the law of conserv of energy. in the form of the first law of thermodynamics, this state that a close system energi is constant unless energi is transfer in or out by work or heat, and that no energi is lost in transfer. the total inflow of energi into a system must equal the total outflow of energi from the system, plus the chang in the energi contain within the system. whenev one measur (or calculates) the total energi of a system of particl whose interact do not depend explicit on time, it is found that the total energi of the system alway remain constant.whil heat can alway be fulli convert into work in a revers isotherm expans of an ideal gas, for cyclic process of practic interest in heat engin the second law of thermodynam state that the system do work alway lose some energi as wast heat. this creat a limit to the amount of heat energi that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit call the avail energy. mechan and other form of energi can be transform in the other direct into thermal energi without such limitations. the total energi of a system can be calcul by ad up all form of energi in the system. richard feynman said dure a lecture: there is a fact, or if you wish, a law, govern all natur phenomena that are known to date. there is no known except to this law \u2013 it is exact so far as we know. the law is call the conserv of energy. it state that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that doe not chang in manifold chang which natur undergoes. that is a most abstract idea, becaus it is a mathemat principle; it say that there is a numer quantiti which doe not chang when someth happens. it is not a descript of a mechanism, or anyth concrete; it is just a strang fact that we can calcul some number and when we finish watch natur go through her trick and calcul the number again, it is the same. most kind of energi (with gravit energi be a notabl exception) are subject to strict local conserv law as well. in this case, energi can onli be exchang between adjac region of space, and all observ agre as to the volumetr densiti of energi in ani given space. there is also a global law of conserv of energy, state that the total energi of the univers cannot change; this is a corollari of the local law, but not vice versa.thi law is a fundament principl of physics. as shown rigor by noether theorem, the conserv of energi is a mathemat consequ of translat symmetri of time, a properti of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that make them independ of their locat on the time coordinate. put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physic indistinguishable. this is becaus energi is the quantiti which is canon conjug to time. this mathemat entangl of energi and time also result in the uncertainti principl - it is imposs to defin the exact amount of energi dure ani definit time interval. the uncertainti principl should not be confus with energi conserv - rather it provid mathemat limit to which energi can in principl be defin and measured. each of the basic forc of natur is associ with a differ type of potenti energy, and all type of potenti energi (like all other type of energy) appear as system mass, whenev present. for example, a compress spring will be slight more massiv than befor it was compressed. likewise, whenev energi is transfer between system by ani mechanism, an associ mass is transfer with it. in quantum mechan energi is express use the hamiltonian operator. on ani time scales, the uncertainti in the energi is by \u03b4 e \u03b4 t \u2265 \u210f {\\displaystyl \\delta e\\delta t\\geq {\\frac {\\hbar which is similar in form to the heisenberg uncertainti principl (but not realli mathemat equival thereto, sinc h and t are not dynam conjug variables, neither in classic nor in quantum mechanics). in particl physics, this inequ permit a qualit understand of virtual particl which carri momentum, exchang by which and with real particles, is respons for the creation of all known fundament forc (more accur known as fundament interactions). virtual photon are also respons for electrostat interact between electr charg (which result in coulomb law), for spontan radiat decay of exit atom and nuclear states, for the casimir force, for van der waal bond forc and some other observ phenomena. == energi transfer == === close system === energi transfer can be consid for the special case of system which are close to transfer of matter. the portion of the energi which is transfer by conserv forc over a distanc is measur as the work the sourc system doe on the receiv system. the portion of the energi which doe not do work dure the transfer is call heat. energi can be transfer between system in a varieti of ways. exampl includ the transmiss of electromagnet energi via photons, physic collis which transfer kinet energy, and the conduct transfer of thermal energy. energi is strict conserv and is also local conserv wherev it can be defined. in thermodynamics, for close systems, the process of energi transfer is describ by the first law: where e {\\displaystyl e} is the amount of energi transferred, w {\\displaystyl w} repres the work done on the system, and q {\\displaystyl q} repres the heat flow into the system. as a simplification, the heat term, q {\\displaystyl q} , is sometim ignored, especi when the thermal effici of the transfer is high. this simplifi equat is the one use to defin the joule, for example. === open system === beyond the constraint of close systems, open system can gain or lose energi in associ with matter transfer (both of these process are illustr by fuel an auto, a system which gain in energi thereby, without addit of either work or heat). denot this energi by e {\\displaystyl e} , one may write == thermodynam == === intern energi === intern energi is the sum of all microscop form of energi of a system. it is the energi need to creat the system. it is relat to the potenti energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometr aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinet energy. thermodynam is chiefli concern with chang in intern energi and not it absolut value, which is imposs to determin with thermodynam alone. === first law of thermodynam === the first law of thermodynam assert that energi (but not necessarili thermodynam free energy) is alway conserv and that heat flow is a form of energi transfer. for homogen systems, with a well-defin temperatur and pressure, a common use corollari of the first law is that, for a system subject onli to pressur forc and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-ful of gas) without chemic changes, the differenti chang in the intern energi of the system (with a gain in energi signifi by a posit quantity) is given as d e = t d s \u2212 p d v {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {d} e=t\\mathrm {d} s-p\\mathrm {d} v\\,} ,where the first term on the right is the heat transfer into the system, express in term of temperatur t and entropi s (in which entropi increas and the chang ds is posit when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identifi as work done on the system, where pressur is p and volum v (the negat sign result sinc compress of the system requir work to be done on it and so the volum change, dv, is negat when work is done on the system). this equat is high specific, ignor all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravit forces, effect such as advect of ani form of energi other than heat and pv-work. the general formul of the first law (i.e., conserv of energy) is valid even in situat in which the system is not homogeneous. for these case the chang in intern energi of a close system is express in a general form by d e = \u03b4 q + \u03b4 w {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {d} e=\\delta q+\\delta w} where \u03b4 q {\\displaystyl \\delta q} is the heat suppli to the system and \u03b4 w {\\displaystyl \\delta w} is the work appli to the system. === equipartit of energi === the energi of a mechan harmon oscil (a mass on a spring) is altern kinet and potenti energy. at two point in the oscil cycl it is entir kinetic, and at two point it is entir potential. over the whole cycle, or over mani cycles, net energi is thus equal split between kinet and potential. this is call equipartit principle; total energi of a system with mani degre of freedom is equal split among all avail degre of freedom. this principl is vital import to understand the behaviour of a quantiti close relat to energy, call entropy. entropi is a measur of even of a distribut of energi between part of a system. when an isol system is given more degre of freedom (i.e., given new avail energi state that are the same as exist states), then total energi spread over all avail degre equal without distinct between \"new\" and \"old\" degrees. this mathemat result is call the second law of thermodynamics. the second law of thermodynam is valid onli for system which are near or in equilibrium state. for non-equilibrium systems, the law govern system behavior are still debatable. one of the guid principl for these system is the principl of maximum entropi production. it state that nonequilibrium system behav in such a way to maxim it entropi production. == see also == == note == == refer == == further read == === journal === the journal of energi histori / revu d'histoir de l'\u00e9nergi

rather, they depend on how quick the shear occurs. viscos is the materi properti which relat the viscous stress in a materi to the rate of chang of a deform (the strain rate). although it appli to general flows, it is easi to visual and defin in a simpl shear flow, such as a planar couett flow. in the couett flow, a fluid is trap between two infinit larg plates, one fix and one in parallel motion at constant speed u {\\displaystyl u} (see illustr to the right). if the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steadi state the fluid particl move parallel to it, and their speed vari from {\\displaystyl at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. each layer of fluid move faster than the one just below it, and friction between them give rise to a forc resist their relat motion. in particular, the fluid appli on the top plate a forc in the direct opposit to it motion, and an equal but opposit forc on the bottom plate. an extern forc is therefor requir in order to keep the top plate move at constant speed. in mani fluids, the flow veloc is observ to vari linear from zero at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. moreover, the magnitud f {\\displaystyl f} of the forc act on the top plate is found to be proport to the speed u {\\displaystyl u} and the area a {\\displaystyl a} of each plate, and invers proport to their separ y {\\displaystyl y} : f = \u03bc a u y . {\\displaystyl f=\\mu a{\\frac {u}{y}}.} the proport factor \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is the dynam viscos of the fluid, with unit of pa \u22c5 s {\\displaystyl {\\text{pa}}\\cdot {\\text{s}}} (pascal-second), often simpli refer to as the viscosity. the ratio u / y {\\displaystyl u/y} is call the rate of shear deform or shear velocity, and is the deriv of the fluid speed in the direct perpendicular to the plate (see illustr to the right). if the veloc doe not vari linear with y {\\displaystyl y} , then the appropri general is: \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y , {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}},} where \u03c4 = f / a {\\displaystyl \\tau =f/a} , and \u2202 u / \u2202 y {\\displaystyl \\partial u/\\parti y} is the local shear velocity. this express is refer to as newton law of viscosity. in shear flow with planar symmetry, it is what defin \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is a special case of the general definit of viscos (see below), which can be express in coordinate-fre form. use of the greek letter mu ( \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } ) for the dynam viscos (sometim also call the absolut viscosity) is common among mechan and chemic engineers, as well as mathematician and physicists. however, the greek letter eta ( \u03b7 {\\displaystyl \\eta } ) is also use by chemists, physicists, and the iupac. the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is sometim also call the shear viscosity. however, at least one author discourag the use of this terminology, note that \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } can appear in nonshear flow in addit to shear flows. === general definit === in veri general terms, the viscous stress in a fluid are defin as those result from the relat veloc of differ fluid particles. as such, the viscous stress must depend on spatial gradient of the flow velocity. if the veloc gradient are small, then to a first approxim the viscous stress depend onli on the first deriv of the velocity. (for newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) in cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as \u03c4 i j = \u2211 k \u2211 \u2113 \u03bc i j k \u2113 \u2202 v k \u2202 r \u2113 , {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}=\\sum _{k}\\sum _{\\ell }\\mu _{ijk\\el }{\\frac {\\partial v_{k}}{\\partial r_{\\ell }}},} where \u03bc i j k \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijk\\el }} is a viscos tensor that map the veloc gradient tensor \u2202 v k / \u2202 r \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\partial v_{k}/\\partial r_{\\ell }} onto the viscous stress tensor \u03c4 i j {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}} . sinc the indic in this express can vari from to there are \"viscos coefficients\" \u03bc i j k l {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijkl}} in total. however, assum that the viscos tensor is isotrop reduc these coeffici to three independ paramet \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , \u03b2 {\\displaystyl \\beta } , \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\gamma } : \u03bc i j k \u2113 = \u03b1 \u03b4 i j \u03b4 k \u2113 + \u03b2 \u03b4 i k \u03b4 j \u2113 + \u03b3 \u03b4 i \u2113 \u03b4 j k , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijk\\el }=\\alpha \\delta _{ij}\\delta _{k\\ell }+\\beta \\delta _{ik}\\delta _{j\\ell }+\\gamma \\delta _{i\\el }\\delta _{jk},} and furthermore, it is assum that no viscous forc may aris when the fluid is undergo simpl rigid-bodi rotation, thus \u03b2 = \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\beta =\\gamma } , leav onli two independ parameters. the most usual decomposit is in term of the standard (scalar) viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } and the bulk viscos \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } such that \u03b1 = \u03ba \u2212 \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\alpha =\\kappa -{\\tfrac } and \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\beta =\\gamma =\\mu } . in vector notat this appear as: \u03c4 = \u03bc [ \u2207 v + ( \u2207 v ) \u2020 ] \u2212 ( \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba ) ( \u2207 \u22c5 v ) \u03b4 , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {\\tau } =\\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf {v} +(\\nabla \\mathbf {v} )^{\\dagger }\\right]-\\left({\\frac -\\kappa \\right)(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} )\\mathbf {\\delta } ,} where \u03b4 {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {\\delta } } is the unit tensor, and the dagger \u2020 {\\displaystyl \\dagger } denot the transpose. this equat can be thought of as a general form of newton law of viscosity. the bulk viscos (also call volum viscosity) express a type of intern friction that resist the shearless compress or expans of a fluid. knowledg of \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is frequent not necessari in fluid dynam problems. for example, an incompress fluid satisfi \u2207 \u22c5 v = {\\displaystyl \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} and so the term contain \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } drop out. moreover, \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is often assum to be neglig for gase sinc it is {\\displaystyl in a monatom ideal gas. one situat in which \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } can be import is the calcul of energi loss in sound and shock waves, describ by stoke law of sound attenuation, sinc these phenomena involv rapid expans and compressions. it is worth emphas that the abov express are not fundament law of nature, but rather definit of viscosity. as such, their util for ani given material, as well as mean for measur or calcul the viscosity, must be establish use separ means. === kinemat viscos === in fluid dynamics, it is sometim more conveni to work in term of the kinemat viscos (sometim also call the momentum diffusivity), defin as the ratio of the viscos \u03bc to the densiti of the fluid \u03c1. it is usual denot by the greek letter nu (\u03bd) and has dimens ( l e n g t h ) / t i m e {\\displaystyl \\mathrm } : \u03bd = \u03bc \u03c1 , {\\displaystyl \\nu ={\\frac {\\mu }{\\rho }},} in order to distinguish it from the dynam viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which has dimens f o r c e \u00d7 t i m e / a r e a {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {force\\tim time/area} } . == momentum transport == transport theori provid an altern interpret of viscos in term of momentum transport: viscos is the materi properti which character momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conduct character heat transport, and (mass) diffus character mass transport. to see this, note that in newton law of viscosity, \u03c4 = \u03bc ( \u2202 u / \u2202 y ) {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu (\\partial u/\\parti y)} , the shear stress \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } has unit equival to a momentum flux, i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. thus, \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } can be interpret as specifi the flow of momentum in the y {\\displaystyl y} direct from one fluid layer to the next. per newton law of viscosity, this momentum flow occur across a veloc gradient, and the magnitud of the correspond momentum flux is determin by the viscosity. the analog with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. just as heat flow from high temperatur to low temperatur and mass flow from high densiti to low density, momentum flow from high veloc to low velocity. these behavior are all describ by compact expressions, call constitut relations, whose one-dimension form are given here: j = \u2212 d \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202 x (fick law of diffusion) q = \u2212 k t \u2202 t \u2202 x (fourier law of heat conduction) \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y (newton law of viscosity) {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf {j} &=-d{\\frac {\\partial \\rho }{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fick law of {q} &=-k_{t}{\\frac {\\partial t}{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fouri law of heat &=\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}}&&{\\text{(newton law of viscosity)}}\\end{aligned}}} where \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } is the density, j {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {j} } and q {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {q} } are the mass and heat fluxes, and d {\\displaystyl d} and k t {\\displaystyl k_{t}} are the mass diffus and thermal conductivity. the fact that mass, momentum, and energi (heat) transport are among the most relev process in continuum mechan is not a coincidence: these are among the few physic quantiti that are conserv at the microscop level in interparticl collisions. thus, rather than be dictat by the fast and complex microscop interact timescale, their dynam occur on macroscop timescales, as describ by the various equat of transport theori and hydrodynamics. == newtonian and non-newtonian fluid == newton law of viscos is not a fundament law of nature, but rather a constitut equat (like hook law, fick law, and ohm law) which serv to defin the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it form is motiv by experi which show that for a wide rang of fluids, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is independ of strain rate. such fluid are call newtonian. gases, water, and mani common liquid can be consid newtonian in ordinari condit and contexts. however, there are mani non-newtonian fluid that signific deviat from this behavior. for example: shear-thicken liquids, whose viscos increas with the rate of shear strain. shear-thin liquids, whose viscos decreas with the rate of shear strain. thixotrop liquids, that becom less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. rheopect (dilatant) liquids, that becom more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. bingham plastic that behav as a solid at low stress but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.trouton ratio is the ratio of extension viscos to shear viscosity. for a newtonian fluid, the trouton ratio is shear-thin liquid are veri commonly, but misleadingly, describ as thixotropic.even for a newtonian fluid, the viscos usual depend on it composit and temperature. for gase and other compress fluids, it depend on temperatur and vari veri slowli with pressure. the viscos of some fluid may depend on other factors. a magnetorheolog fluid, for example, becom thicker when subject to a magnet field, possibl to the point of behav like a solid. == in solid == the viscous forc that aris dure fluid flow must not be confus with the elast forc that aris in a solid in respons to shear, compress or extens stresses. while in the latter the stress is proport to the amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proport to the rate of deform over time. for this reason, maxwel use the term fugit elast for fluid viscosity. however, mani liquid (includ water) will briefli react like elast solid when subject to sudden stress. conversely, mani \"solids\" (even granite) will flow like liquids, albeit veri slowly, even under arbitrarili small stress. such materi are therefor best describ as possess both elast (reaction to deformation) and viscos (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, be viscoelastic. viscoelast solid may exhibit both shear viscos and bulk viscosity. the extension viscos is a linear combin of the shear and bulk viscos that describ the reaction of a solid elast materi to elongation. it is wide use for character polymers. in geology, earth materi that exhibit viscous deform at least three order of magnitud greater than their elast deform are sometim call rheids. == measur == viscos is measur with various type of viscomet and rheometers. a rheomet is use for fluid that cannot be defin by a singl valu of viscos and therefor requir more paramet to be set and measur than is the case for a viscometer. close temperatur control of the fluid is essenti to obtain accur measurements, particular in materi like lubricants, whose viscos can doubl with a chang of onli \u00b0c.for some fluids, the viscos is constant over a wide rang of shear rate (newtonian fluids). the fluid without a constant viscos (non-newtonian fluids) cannot be describ by a singl number. non-newtonian fluid exhibit a varieti of differ correl between shear stress and shear rate. one of the most common instrument for measur kinemat viscos is the glass capillari viscometer. in coat industries, viscos may be measur with a cup in which the efflux time is measured. there are sever sort of cup \u2013 such as the zahn cup and the ford viscos cup \u2013 with the usag of each type vari main accord to the industry. the efflux time can also be convert to kinemat viscos (centistokes, cst) through the convers equations. also use in coatings, a stormer viscomet use load-bas rotat in order to determin viscosity. the viscos is report in kreb unit (ku), which are uniqu to stormer viscometers. vibrat viscomet can also be use to measur viscosity. resonant, or vibrat viscomet work by creat shear wave within the liquid. in this method, the sensor is submerg in the fluid and is made to reson at a specif frequency. as the surfac of the sensor shear through the liquid, energi is lost due to it viscosity. this dissip energi is then measur and convert into a viscos reading. a higher viscos caus a greater loss of energy.extension viscos can be measur with various rheomet that appli extension stress. volum viscos can be measur with an acoust rheometer. appar viscos is a calcul deriv from test perform on drill fluid use in oil or gas well development. these calcul and test help engin develop and maintain the properti of the drill fluid to the specif required. nanoviscos (viscos sens by nanoprobes) can be measur by fluoresc correl spectroscopy. == unit == the si unit of dynam viscos is the newton-second per squar meter also frequent express in the equival form pascal-second (pa\u00b7s) and kilogram per meter per second the cgs unit is the pois (p, or = pa\u00b7s), name after jean l\u00e9onard mari poiseuille. it is common expressed, particular in astm standards, as centipois (cp), becaus it is more conveni (for instanc the viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cp), and one centipois is equal to the si millipasc second (mpa\u00b7s). the si unit of kinemat viscos is squar meter per second wherea the cgs unit for kinemat viscos is the stoke (st, or = name after sir georg gabriel stokes. in u.s. usage, stoke is sometim use as the singular form. the submultipl centistok (cst) is often use instead, cst = = the kinemat viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cst. the most frequent use system of us customary, or imperial, unit are the british gravit (bg) and english engin (ee). in the bg system, dynam viscos has unit of pound-second per squar foot and in the ee system it has unit of pound-force-second per squar foot note that the pound and pound-forc are equivalent; the two system differ onli in how forc and mass are defined. in the bg system the pound is a basic unit from which the unit of mass (the slug) is defin by newton second law, wherea in the ee system the unit of forc and mass (the pound-forc and pound-mass respectively) are defin independ through the second law use the proport constant gc. kinemat viscos has unit of squar feet per second in both the bg and ee systems. nonstandard unit includ the reyn, a british unit of dynam viscosity. in the automot industri the viscos index is use to describ the chang of viscos with temperature. the reciproc of viscos is fluidity, usual symbol by \u03d5 = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\phi } or f = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl } , depend on the convent used, measur in reciproc pois or sometim call the rhe. fluiditi is seldom use in engin practice. at one time the petroleum industri reli on measur kinemat viscos by mean of the saybolt viscometer, and express kinemat viscos in unit of saybolt univers second (sus). other abbrevi such as ssu (saybolt second universal) or suv (saybolt univers viscosity) are sometim used. kinemat viscos in centistok can be convert from sus accord to the arithmet and the refer tabl provid in astm d == molecular origin == in general, the viscos of a system depend in detail on how the molecul constitut the system interact. there are no simpl but correct express for the viscos of a fluid. the simplest exact express are the green\u2013kubo relat for the linear shear viscos or the transient time correl function express deriv by evan and morriss in although these express are each exact, calcul the viscos of a dens fluid use these relat current requir the use of molecular dynam comput simulations. on the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilut gas. even elementari assumpt about how gas molecul move and interact lead to a basic understand of the molecular origin of viscosity. more sophist treatment can be construct by systemat coarse-grain the equat of motion of the gas molecules. an exampl of such a treatment is chapman\u2013enskog theory, which deriv express for the viscos of a dilut gas from the boltzmann equation.momentum transport in gase is general mediat by discret molecular collisions, and in liquid by attract forc which bind molecul close together. becaus of this, the dynam viscos of liquid are typic much larger than those of gases. === pure gase === viscos in gase aris princip from the molecular diffus that transport momentum between layer of flow. an elementari calcul for a dilut gas at temperatur t {\\displaystyl t} and densiti \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c1 \u03bb k b t \u03c0 m , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\alpha \\rho \\lambda {\\sqrt {\\frac m}}},} where k b {\\displaystyl k_{\\text{b}}} is the boltzmann constant, m {\\displaystyl m} the molecular mass, and \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } a numer constant on the order of {\\displaystyl . the quantiti \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } , the mean free path, measur the averag distanc a molecul travel between collisions. even without a priori knowledg of \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , this express has interest implications. in particular, sinc \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is typic invers proport to densiti and increas with temperature, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } itself should increas with temperatur and be independ of densiti at fix temperature. in fact, both of these predict persist in more sophist treatments, and accur describ experiment observations. note that this behavior run counter to common intuit regard liquids, for which viscos typic decreas with temperature.for rigid elast sphere of diamet \u03c3 {\\displaystyl \\sigma } , \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } can be computed, give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c0 / k b m t \u03c3 . {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {\\alpha }{\\pi {\\sqrt {k_{\\text{b}}mt}}{\\sigma in this case \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is independ of temperature, so \u03bc \u221d t / {\\displaystyl \\mu \\propto . for more complic molecular models, however, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } depend on temperatur in a non-trivi way, and simpl kinet argument as use here are inadequate. more fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becom imprecis for particl that interact over a finit range, which limit the use of the concept for describ real-world gases. ==== chapman\u2013enskog theori ==== a techniqu develop by sydney chapman and david enskog in the earli allow a more refin calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is base on the boltzmann equation, which provid a systemat statist descript of a dilut gas in term of intermolecular interactions. as such, their techniqu allow accur calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } for more realist molecular models, such as those incorpor intermolecular attract rather than just hard-cor repulsion. it turn out that a more realist model of interact is essenti for accur predict of the temperatur depend of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which experi show increas more rapid than the t / {\\displaystyl trend predict for rigid elast spheres. indeed, the chapman\u2013enskog analysi show that the predict temperatur depend can be tune by vari the paramet in various molecular models. a simpl exampl is the sutherland model, which describ rigid elast sphere with weak mutual attraction. in such a case, the attract forc can be treat perturbatively, which lead to a particular simpl express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } : \u03bc = \u03c3 ( k b m t \u03c0 ) / ( + s t ) \u2212 , {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {k_{\\text{b}}mt}{\\pi where s {\\displaystyl s} is independ of temperature, be determin onli by the paramet of the intermolecular attraction. to connect with experiment, it is conveni to rewrit as \u03bc = \u03bc ( t t ) / t + s t + s , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\mu where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos at temperatur t {\\displaystyl . if \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is known from experi at t = t {\\displaystyl and at least one other temperature, then s {\\displaystyl s} can be calculated. it turn out that express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } obtain in this way are accur for a number of gase over a sizabl rang of temperatures. on the other hand, chapman & cowl argu that this success doe not impli that molecul actual interact accord to the sutherland model. rather, they interpret the predict for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } as a simpl interpol which is valid for some gase over fix rang of temperature, but otherwis doe not provid a pictur of intermolecular interact which is fundament correct and general. slight more sophist models, such as the lennard-jon potential, may provid a better picture, but onli at the cost of a more opaqu depend on temperature. in some system the assumpt of spheric symmetri must be abandon as well, as is the case for vapor with high polar molecul like ==== bulk viscos ==== in the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscos aris in gase whenev there are non-neglig relax timescal govern the exchang of energi between the translat energi of molecul and their intern energy, e.g. rotat and vibrational. as such, the bulk viscos is {\\displaystyl for a monatom ideal gas, in which the intern energi of molecul in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide, whose molecul possess both rotat and vibrat energy. === pure liquid === in contrast with gases, there is no simpl yet accur pictur for the molecular origin of viscos in liquids. at the simplest level of description, the relat motion of adjac layer in a liquid is oppos primarili by attract molecular forc act across the layer boundary. in this picture, one (correctly) expect viscos to decreas with increas temperature. this is becaus increas temperatur increas the random thermal motion of the molecules, which make it easier for them to overcom their attract interactions.build on this visualization, a simpl theori can be construct in analog with the discret structur of a solid: group of molecul in a liquid are visual as form \"cages\" which surround and enclos singl molecules. these cage can be occupi or unoccupied, and stronger molecular attract correspond to stronger cages. due to random thermal motion, a molecul \"hops\" between cage at a rate which vari invers with the strength of molecular attractions. in equilibrium these \"hops\" are not bias in ani direction. on the other hand, in order for two adjac layer to move relat to each other, the \"hops\" must be bias in the direct of the relat motion. the forc requir to sustain this direct motion can be estim for a given shear rate, lead to where n a {\\displaystyl n_{a}} is the avogadro constant, h {\\displaystyl h} is the planck constant, v {\\displaystyl v} is the volum of a mole of liquid, and t b {\\displaystyl t_{b}} is the normal boil point. this result has the same form as the widespread and accur empir relat where a {\\displaystyl a} and b {\\displaystyl b} are constant fit from data. on the other hand, sever author express caution with respect to this model. error as larg as can be encount use equat compar with fit equat to experiment data. more fundamentally, the physic assumpt under equat have been criticized. it has also been argu that the exponenti depend in equat doe not necessarili describ experiment observ more accur than simpler, non-exponenti expressions.in light of these shortcomings, the develop of a less ad hoc model is a matter of practic interest. forego simplic in favor of precision, it is possibl to write rigor express for viscos start from the fundament equat of motion for molecules. a classic exampl of this approach is irving\u2013kirkwood theory. on the other hand, such express are given as averag over multiparticl correl function and are therefor difficult to appli in practice. in general, empir deriv express (base on exist viscos measurements) appear to be the onli consist reliabl mean of calcul viscos in liquids. === mixtur and blend === ==== gaseous mixtur ==== the same molecular-kinet pictur of a singl compon gas can also be appli to a gaseous mixture. for instance, in the chapman\u2013enskog approach the viscos \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} of a binari mixtur of gase can be written in term of the individu compon viscos \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu , their respect volum fractions, and the intermolecular interactions. as for the single-compon gas, the depend of \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} on the paramet of the intermolecular interact enter through various collision integr which may not be express in term of elementari functions. to obtain usabl express for \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} which reason match experiment data, the collision integr typic must be evalu use some combin of analyt calcul and empir fitting. an exampl of such a procedur is the sutherland approach for the single-compon gas, discuss above. ==== blend of liquid ==== as for pure liquids, the viscos of a blend of liquid is difficult to predict from molecular principles. one method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theori present abov for a pure liquid. this can be done with vari level of sophistication. one use express result from such an analysi is the lederer\u2013roegi equat for a binari mixture: ln \u2061 \u03bc blend = x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc + \u03b1 x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\ln \\mu _{\\text{blend}}={\\frac \\mu {\\alpha \\mu where \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } is an empir parameter, and x , {\\displaystyl and \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu are the respect mole fraction and viscos of the compon liquids.sinc blend is an import process in the lubric and oil industries, a varieti of empir and proprieti equat exist for predict the viscos of a blend, besid those stem direct from molecular theory. === solut and suspens === ==== aqeuous solut ==== depend on the solut and rang of concentration, an aqueous electrolyt solut can have either a larger or smaller viscos compar with pure water at the same temperatur and pressure. for instance, a salin (sodium chloride) solut has viscos over time that of pure water, wherea a potassium iodid solut has viscos about time that of pure water. an ideal model of dilut electrolyt solut lead to the follow predict for the viscos \u03bc s {\\displaystyl \\mu _{s}} of a solution: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu {c}},} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the solvent, c {\\displaystyl c} is the concentration, and a {\\displaystyl a} is a posit constant which depend on both solvent and solut properties. however, this express is onli valid for veri dilut solutions, have c {\\displaystyl c} less than mol/l. for higher concentrations, addit term are necessari which account for higher-ord molecular correlations: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c + b c + c c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu where b {\\displaystyl b} and c {\\displaystyl c} are fit from data. in particular, a negat valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is abl to account for the decreas in viscos observ in some solutions. estim valu of these constant are shown below for sodium chlorid and potassium iodid at temperatur \u00b0c (mol = mole, l = liter). ==== suspens ==== in a suspens of solid particl (e.g. micron-s sphere suspend in oil), an effect viscos \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be defin in term of stress and strain compon which are averag over a volum larg compar with the distanc between the suspend particles, but small with respect to macroscop dimensions. such suspens general exhibit non-newtonian behavior. however, for dilut system in steadi flows, the behavior is newtonian and express for \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be deriv direct from the particl dynamics. in a veri dilut system, with volum fraction \u03d5 \u2272 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\lesssim , interact between the suspend particl can be ignored. in such a case one can explicit calcul the flow field around each particl independently, and combin the result to obtain \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} . for spheres, this result in the einstein equation: \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the suspend liquid. the linear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is a direct consequ of neglect interparticl interactions; in general, one will have \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where the coeffici b {\\displaystyl b} may depend on the particl shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks). experiment determin of the precis valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is difficult, however: even the predict b = / {\\displaystyl for sphere has not been conclus validated, with various experi find valu in the rang \u2272 b \u2272 {\\displaystyl b\\lesssim . this defici has been attribut to difficulti in control experiment conditions.in denser suspensions, \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} acquir a nonlinear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } , which indic the import of interparticl interactions. various analyt and semi-empir scheme exist for captur this regime. at the most basic level, a term quadrat in \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is ad to \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} : \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu and the coeffici b {\\displaystyl is fit from experiment data or approxim from the microscop theory. in general, however, one should be cautious in appli such simpl formula sinc non-newtonian behavior appear in dens suspens ( \u03d5 \u2273 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\gtrsim for spheres), or in suspens of elong or flexibl particles.ther is a distinct between a suspens of solid particles, describ above, and an emulsion. the latter is a suspens of tini droplets, which themselv may exhibit intern circulation. the presenc of intern circul can notic decreas the observ effect viscosity, and differ theoret or semi-empir model must be used. === amorph materi === in the high and low temperatur limits, viscous flow in amorph materi (e.g. in glass and melts) has the arrhenius form: \u03bc = a e q / ( r t ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu =ae^{q/(rt)},} where q is a relev activ energy, given in term of molecular parameters; t is temperature; r is the molar gas constant; and a is approxim a constant. the activ energi q take a differ valu depend on whether the high or low temperatur limit is be considered: it chang from a high valu qh at low temperatur (in the glassi state) to a low valu ql at high temperatur (in the liquid state). for intermedi temperatures, q {\\displaystyl q} vari nontrivi with temperatur and the simpl arrhenius form fails. on the other hand, the two-exponenti equat \u03bc = a t exp \u2061 ( b r t ) [ + c exp \u2061 ( d r t ) ] , {\\displaystyl \\mu =at\\exp \\left({\\frac \\left({\\frac {d}{rt}}\\right)\\right],} where a {\\displaystyl a} , b {\\displaystyl b} , c {\\displaystyl c} , d {\\displaystyl d} are all constants, provid a good fit to experiment data over the entir rang of temperatures, while at the same time reduc to the correct arrhenius form in the low and high temperatur limits. besid be a conveni fit to data, the express can also be deriv from various theoret model of amorph materi at the atom level.a two-exponenti equat for the viscos can be deriv within the dyre shove model of supercool liquids, where the arrhenius energi barrier is identifi with the high-frequ shear modulus time a characterist shove volume. upon specifi the temperatur depend of the shear modulus via thermal expans and via the repuls part of the intermolecular potential, anoth two-exponenti equat is retrieved: \u03bc = exp \u2061 { v c c g k b t exp \u2061 [ ( + \u03bb ) \u03b1 t t g ( \u2212 t t g ) ] } {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\exp {\\left\\{{\\frac {v_{c}c_{g}}{k_{b}t}}\\exp )\\alpha {t}{t_{g}}}\\right)\\right]}\\right\\}}} where c g {\\displaystyl c_{g}} denot the high-frequ shear modulus of the materi evalu at a temperatur equal to the glass transit temperatur t g {\\displaystyl t_{g}} , v c {\\displaystyl v_{c}} is the so-cal shove volume, i.e. it is the characterist volum of the group of atom involv in the shove event by which an atom/molecul escap from the cage of nearest-neighbours, typic on the order of the volum occupi by few atoms. furthermore, \u03b1 t {\\displaystyl \\alpha _{t}} is the thermal expans coeffici of the material, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is a paramet which measur the steep of the power-law rise of the ascend flank of the first peak of the radial distribut function, and is quantit relat to the repuls part of the interatom potential. finally, k b {\\displaystyl k_{b}} denot the boltzmann constant. === eddi viscos === in the studi of turbul in fluids, a common practic strategi is to ignor the small-scal vortic (or eddies) in the motion and to calcul a large-scal motion with an effect viscosity, call the \"eddi viscosity\", which character the transport and dissip of energi in the smaller-scal flow (see larg eddi simulation). in contrast to the viscos of the fluid itself, which must be posit by the second law of thermodynamics, the eddi viscos can be negative. == select substanc == observ valu of viscos vari over sever order of magnitude, even for common substanc (see the order of magnitud tabl below). for instance, a sucros (sugar) solut has a viscos over time that of water, and time that of air. more dramatically, pitch has been estim to have a viscos billion time that of water. === water === the dynam viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } of water is about mpa\u00b7 at room temperatur \u00b0c). as a function of temperatur in kelvins, the viscos can be estim use the semi-empir vogel-fulcher-tammann equation: \u03bc = a exp \u2061 ( b t \u2212 c ) {\\displaystyl \\mu =a\\exp \\left({\\frac {b}{t-c}}\\right)} where a = mpa\u00b7s, b = k, and c = k. experiment determin valu of the viscos are also given in the tabl below. note that at \u00b0c the dynam viscos is about cp and the kinemat viscos is about cst. === air === under standard atmospher condit \u00b0c and pressur of bar), the dynam viscos of air is \u03bcpa\u00b7s, rough time smaller than the viscos of water at the same temperature. except at veri high pressure, the viscos of air depend most on the temperature. among the mani possibl approxim formula for the temperatur depend (see temperatur depend of viscosity), one is: \u03b7 air = \u22c5 \u2212 \u22c5 t {\\displaystyl \\eta which is accur in the rang \u00b0c to \u00b0c. for this formula to be valid, the temperatur must be given in kelvins; \u03b7 air {\\displaystyl \\eta _{\\text{air}}} then correspond to the viscos in pa\u00b7s. === other common substanc === === order of magnitud estim === the follow tabl illustr the rang of viscos valu observ in common substances. unless otherwis noted, a temperatur of \u00b0c and a pressur of atmospher are assumed. certain substanc of variabl composit or with non-newtonian

radians. this is becaus radian have a mathemat \"naturalness\" that lead to a more eleg formul of a number of import results. most notably, result in analysi involv trigonometr function can be eleg stated, when the function argument are express in radians. for example, the use of radian lead to the simpl limit formula lim h \u2192 sin \u2061 h h = , {\\displaystyl \\lim _{h\\rightarrow {\\sin which is the basi of mani other ident in mathematics, includ d d x sin \u2061 x = cos \u2061 x {\\displaystyl {\\frac {d}{dx}}\\sin x=\\cos x} d d x sin \u2061 x = \u2212 sin \u2061 x . {\\displaystyl {\\frac x=-\\sin x.} becaus of these and other properties, the trigonometr function appear in solut to mathemat problem that are not obvious relat to the function geometr mean (for example, the solut to the differenti equat d y d x = \u2212 y {\\displaystyl {\\tfrac , the evalu of the integr \u222b d x + x , {\\displaystyl \\textstyl \\int {\\frac and so on). in all such cases, it is found that the argument to the function are most natur written in the form that corresponds, in geometr contexts, to the radian measur of angles. the trigonometr function also have simpl and eleg seri expans when radian are used. for example, when x is in radians, the taylor seri for sin x becomes: sin \u2061 x = x \u2212 x ! + x ! \u2212 x ! + \u22ef . {\\displaystyl \\sin x=x-{\\frac .} if x were express in degrees, then the seri would contain messi factor involv power of if x is the number of degrees, the number of radian is y = \u03c0x / so sin \u2061 x d e g = sin \u2061 y r a d = \u03c0 x

a similar spirit, mathemat import relationship between the sine and cosin function and the exponenti function (see, for example, euler formula) can be eleg stated, when the function argument are in radian (and messi otherwise). == dimension analysi == although the radian is a unit of measure, it is a dimensionless quantity. this can be seen from the definit given earlier: the angl subtend at the centr of a circle, measur in radians, is equal to the ratio of the length of the enclos arc to the length of the circl radius. sinc the unit of measur cancel, this ratio is dimensionless. although polar and spheric coordin use radian to describ coordin in two and three dimensions, the unit is deriv from the radius coordinate, so the angl measur is still dimensionless. == use in physic == the radian is wide use in physic when angular measur are required. for example, angular veloc is typic measur in radian per second (rad/s). one revolut per second is equal to radian per second. similarly, angular acceler is often measur in radian per second per second for the purpos of dimension analysis, the unit of angular veloc and angular acceler are and respectively. likewise, the phase differ of two wave can also be measur in radians. for example, if the phase differ of two wave is radians, where k is an integer, they are consid in phase, whilst if the phase differ of two wave is + \u03c0), where k is an integer, they are consid in antiphase. == si multipl == metric prefix have limit use with radians, and none in mathematics. a milliradian (mrad) is a thousandth of a radian and a microradian (\u03bcrad) is a millionth of a radian, i.e. rad = mrad = \u03bcrad. there are \u00d7 milliradian (\u2248 mrad) in a circle. so a milliradian is just under of the angl subtend by a full circle. this \"real\" unit of angular measur of a circl is in use by telescop sight manufactur use (stadiametric) rangefind in reticles. the diverg of laser beam is also usual measur in milliradians. an approxim of the milliradian rad) is use by nato and other militari organ in gunneri and targeting. each angular mil repres of a circl and is or smaller than the milliradian. for the small angl typic found in target work, the conveni of use the number in calcul outweigh the small mathemat error it introduces. in the past, other gunneri system have use differ approxim to for exampl sweden use the streck and the ussr use be base on the milliradian, the nato mil subtend rough m at a rang of m (at such small angles, the curvatur is negligible). smaller unit like microradian (\u03bcrad) and nanoradian (nrad) are use in astronomy, and can also be use to measur the beam qualiti of laser with ultra-low divergence. more common is arc second, which is rad (around microradians). similarly, the prefix smaller than milli- are potenti use in measur extrem small angles. == see also == angular frequenc minut and second of arc steradian, a higher-dimension analog of the radian which measur solid

two vector field are use to describ this force. the first is the electr field, which describ the forc act on a stationari charg and give the compon of the forc that is independ of motion. the magnet field, in contrast, describ the compon of the forc that is proport to both the speed and direct of charg particles. the field is defin by the lorentz forc law and is, at each instant, perpendicular to both the motion of the charg and the forc it experiences. there are two different, but close relat vector field which are both sometim call the \"magnet field\" written b and h. while both the best name for these field and exact interpret of what these field repres has been the subject of long run debate, there is wide agreement about how the under physic work. historically, the term \"magnet field\" was reserv for h while use other term for b, but mani recent textbook use the term \"magnet field\" to describ b as well as or in place of h. there are mani altern name for both (see sidebar). === the b-field === the magnet field vector b at ani point can be defin as the vector that, when use in the lorentz forc law, correct predict the forc on a charg particl at that point.: here f is the forc on the particle, q is the particl electr charge, v, is the particl velocity, and \u00d7 denot the cross product. the first term in this equat is from the theori of electrostatics, and say that a particl of charg q in an electr field e experi an electr force: f electr = q e . {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {f} _{\\text{electric}}=q\\mathbf {e} .} the second term is the magnet force: f magnet = q ( v \u00d7 b ) . {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {f} _{\\text{magnetic}}=q(\\mathbf {v} \\time \\mathbf {b} ).} use the definit of the cross product, the magnet forc can also be written as a scalar equation: f magnet = q v b sin \u2061 ( \u03b8 ) {\\displaystyl f_{\\text{magnetic}}=qvb\\sin(\\theta )} where fmagnetic, v, and b are the scalar magnitud of their respect vectors, and \u03b8 is the angl between the veloc of the particl and the magnet field. the vector b is defin as the vector field necessari to make the lorentz forc law correct describ the motion of a charg particle. in other words, [t]he command, \"measur the direct and magnitud of the vector b at such and such a place,\" call for the follow operations: take a particl of known charg q. measur the forc on q at rest, to determin e. then measur the forc on the particl when it veloc is v; repeat with v in some other direction. now find a b that make the lorentz forc law fit all these results\u2014that is the magnet field at the place in question. the b field can also be defin by the torqu on a magnet dipole, m. in si units, b is measur in tesla (symbol: t). in gaussian-cg units, b is measur in gauss (symbol: g). (the convers is t = g.) one nanotesla is equival to gamma (symbol: \u03b3). === the h-field === the magnet h field is defined: where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the vacuum permeability, and m is the magnet vector. in a vacuum, b and h are proport to each other, with the multipl constant depend on the physic units. insid a materi they are differ (see h and b insid and outsid magnet materials). the h-field is measur in amper per metr (a/m) in si units, and in oerst (oe) in cgs units. === measur === an instrument use to measur the local magnet field is known as a magnetometer. import class of magnetomet includ use induct magnetomet (or search-coil magnetometers) which measur onli vari magnet fields, rotat coil magnetometers, hall effect magnetometers, nmr magnetometers, squid magnetometers, and fluxgat magnetometers. the magnet field of distant astronom object are measur through their effect on local charg particles. for instance, electron spiral around a field line produc synchrotron radiat that is detect in radio waves. the finest precis for a magnet field measur was attain by graviti probe b at at t). === visual === the field can be visual by a set of magnet field lines, that follow the direct of the field at each point. the line can be construct by measur the strength and direct of the magnet field at a larg number of point (or at everi point in space). then, mark each locat with an arrow (call a vector) point in the direct of the local magnet field with it magnitud proport to the strength of the magnet field. connect these arrow then form a set of magnet field lines. the direct of the magnet field at ani point is parallel to the direct of nearbi field lines, and the local densiti of field line can be made proport to it strength. magnet field line are like streamlin in fluid flow, in that they repres a continu distribution, and a differ resolut would show more or fewer lines. an advantag of use magnet field line as a represent is that mani law of magnet (and electromagnetism) can be state complet and concis use simpl concept such as the \"number\" of field line through a surface. these concept can be quick \"translated\" to their mathemat form. for example, the number of field line through a given surfac is the surfac integr of the magnet field.vari phenomena \"display\" magnet field line as though the field line were physic phenomena. for example, iron file place in a magnet field form line that correspond to \"field lines\". magnet field \"lines\" are also visual display in polar auroras, in which plasma particl dipol interact creat visibl streak of light that line up with the local direct of earth magnet field. field line can be use as a qualit tool to visual magnet forces. in ferromagnet substanc like iron and in plasmas, magnet forc can be understood by imagin that the field line exert a tension, (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressur perpendicular to their length on neighbor field lines. \"unlike\" pole of magnet attract becaus they are link by mani field lines; \"like\" pole repel becaus their field line do not meet, but run parallel, push on each other. the rigor form of this concept is the electromagnet stress\u2013energi tensor. == interact with magnet == perman magnet are object that produc their own persist magnet fields. they are made of ferromagnet materials, such as iron and nickel, that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole. === magnet field of perman magnet === the magnet field of perman magnet can be quit complicated, especi near the magnet. the magnet field of a small straight magnet is proport to the magnet strength (call it magnet dipol moment m). the equat are non-trivi and also depend on the distanc from the magnet and the orient of the magnet. for simpl magnets, m point in the direct of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. flip a bar magnet is equival to rotat it m by degrees. the magnet field of larger magnet can be obtain by model them as a collect of a larg number of small magnet call dipol each have their own m. the magnet field produc by the magnet then is the net magnet field of these dipoles; ani net forc on the magnet is a result of ad up the forc on the individu dipoles. there are two compet model for the natur of these dipoles. these two model produc two differ magnet fields, h and b. outsid a material, though, the two are ident (to a multipl constant) so that in mani case the distinct can be ignored. this is particular true for magnet fields, such as those due to electr currents, that are not generat by magnet materials. === magnet pole model === it is sometim use to model the forc and torqu between two magnet as due to magnet pole repel or attract each other in the same manner as the coulomb forc between electr charges. in this model, a magnet h-field is produc by fictiti magnet charg that are spread over the surfac of each pole. these magnet charg are in fact relat to the magnet field m. the h-field, therefore, is analog to the electr field e, which start at a posit electr charg and end at a negat electr charge. near the north pole, therefore, all h-field line point away from the north pole (whether insid the magnet or out) while near the south pole all h-field line point toward the south pole (whether insid the magnet or out). too, a north pole feel a forc in the direct of the h-field while the forc on the south pole is opposit to the h-field. in the magnet pole model, the elementari magnet dipol m is form by two opposit magnet pole of pole strength qm separ by a small distanc vector d, such that m = qm d. the magnet pole model predict correct the field h both insid and outsid magnet materials, in particular the fact that h is opposit to the magnet field m insid a perman magnet. sinc it is base on the fictiti idea of a magnet charg density, the pole model has limitations. magnet pole cannot exist apart from each other as electr charg can, but alway come in north\u2013south pairs. if a magnet object is divid in half, a new pole appear on the surfac of each piece, so each has a pair of complementari poles. the magnet pole model doe not account for magnet that is produc by electr currents, nor the inher connect between angular momentum and magnetism. the pole model usual treat magnet charg as a mathemat abstraction, rather than a physic properti of particles. however, a magnet monopol is a hypothet particl (or class of particles) that physic has onli one magnet pole (either a north pole or a south pole). in other words, it would possess a \"magnet charge\" analog to an electr charge. magnet field line would start or end on magnet monopoles, so if they exist, they would give except to the rule that magnet field line neither start nor end. modern interest in this concept stem from particl theories, notabl grand unifi theori and superstr theories, that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnet monopoles. these theori and other have inspir extens effort to search for monopoles. despit these efforts, no magnet monopol has been observ to date. in recent research, materi known as spin ice can simul monopoles, but do not contain actual monopoles. === amperian loop model === after \u00f8rsted demonstr that electr current can influenc a magnet object and amper discov that electr current attract and repel each other similar to magnets, it was natur to hypothes that all magnet field are due to electr current loops. in this model develop by ampere, the elementari magnet dipol that make up all magnet is a suffici small amperian loop of current i. the dipol moment of this loop is m = ia where a is the area of the loop. these magnet dipol produc a magnet b-field. one import properti of the b-field produc this way is that magnet b-field line neither start nor end (mathematically, b is a solenoid vector field); a field line may onli extend to infinity, or wrap around to form a close curve, or follow a never-end (possibl chaotic) path. to date, no except to this rule has been found. (see magnet monopol below.) magnet field line exit a magnet near it north pole and enter near it south pole, but insid the magnet b-field line continu through the magnet from the south pole back to the north. if a b-field line enter a magnet somewher it has to leav somewher else; it is not allow to have an end point. more formally, sinc all the magnet field line that enter ani given region must also leav that region, subtract the \"number\" of field line that enter the region from the number that exit give ident zero. mathemat this is equival to gauss law for magnetism: s {\\displaystyl {\\scriptstyl s}} b \u22c5 d a = , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {b} \\cdot {\\rm {d}}\\mathbf {a} where the integr is a surfac integr over the close surfac s (a close surfac is one that complet surround a region with no hole to let ani field line escape). sinc da point outward, the dot product in the integr is posit for b-field point out and negat for b-field point in. the magnet field of a magnet dipol is depict in the figure. from outside, the ideal magnet dipol is ident to that of an ideal electr dipol of the same strength. unlik the electr dipole, a magnet dipol is proper model as a current loop have a current i and an area a. such a current loop has a magnet moment of: m = i a , {\\displaystyl m=ia,\\,} where the direct of m is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depend on the direct of the current use the right-hand rule. an ideal magnet dipol is model as a real magnet dipol whose area a has been reduc to zero and it current i increas to infin such that the product m = ia is finite. this model clarifi the connect between angular momentum and magnet moment, which is the basi of the einstein\u2013d haa effect rotat by magnet and it inverse, the barnett effect or magnet by rotation. rotat the loop faster (in the same direction) increas the current and therefor the magnet moment, for example. === forc between magnet === specifi the forc between two small magnet is quit complic becaus it depend on the strength and orient of both magnet and their distanc and direct relat to each other. the forc is particular sensit to rotat of the magnet due to magnet torque. the forc on each magnet depend on it magnet moment and the magnet field of the other. to understand the forc between magnets, it is use to examin the magnet pole model given above. in this model, the h-field of one magnet push and pull on both pole of a second magnet. if this h-field is the same at both pole of the second magnet then there is no net forc on that magnet sinc the forc is opposit for opposit poles. if, however, the magnet field of the first magnet is nonuniform (such as the h near one of it poles), each pole of the second magnet see a differ field and is subject to a differ force. this differ in the two forc move the magnet in the direct of increas magnet field and may also caus a net torque. this is a specif exampl of a general rule that magnet are attract (or repuls depend on the orient of the magnet) into region of higher magnet field. ani non-uniform magnet field, whether caus by perman magnet or electr currents, exert a forc on a small magnet in this way. the detail of the amperian loop model are differ and more complic but yield the same result: that magnet dipol are attracted/repel into region of higher magnet field. mathematically, the forc on a small magnet have a magnet moment m due to a magnet field b is: f = \u2207 ( m \u22c5 b ) , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {f} ={\\boldsymbol {\\nabla }}\\left(\\mathbf {m} \\cdot \\mathbf {b} \\right),} where the gradient \u2207 is the chang of the quantiti m \u00b7 b per unit distanc and the direct is that of maximum increas of m \u00b7 b. the dot product m \u00b7 b = mbcos(\u03b8), where m and b repres the magnitud of the m and b vector and \u03b8 is the angl between them. if m is in the same direct as b then the dot product is posit and the gradient point \"uphill\" pull the magnet into region of higher b-field (more strict larger m \u00b7 b). this equat is strict onli valid for magnet of zero size, but is often a good approxim for not too larg magnets. the magnet forc on larger magnet is determin by divid them into smaller region each have their own m then sum up the forc on each of these veri small regions. === magnet torqu on perman magnet === if two like pole of two separ magnet are brought near each other, and one of the magnet is allow to turn, it prompt rotat to align itself with the first. in this example, the magnet field of the stationari magnet creat a magnet torqu on the magnet that is free to rotate. this magnet torqu \u03c4 tend to align a magnet pole with the magnet field lines. a compass, therefore, turn to align itself with earth magnet field. in term of the pole model, two equal and opposit magnet charg experienc the same h also experi equal and opposit forces. sinc these equal and opposit forc are in differ locations, this produc a torqu proport to the distanc (perpendicular to the force) between them. with the definit of m as the pole strength time the distanc between the poles, this lead to \u03c4 = m h sin \u03b8, where is a constant call the vacuum permeability, measur v\u00b7s/(a\u00b7m) and \u03b8 is the angl between h and m. mathematically, the torqu \u03c4 on a small magnet is proport both to the appli magnet field and to the magnet moment m of the magnet: \u03c4 = m \u00d7 b = \u03bc m \u00d7 h , {\\displaystyl {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}=\\mathbf {m} \\time \\mathbf {b} =\\mu {m} \\time \\mathbf {h} ,\\,} where \u00d7 repres the vector cross product. this equat includ all of the qualit inform includ above. there is no torqu on a magnet if m is in the same direct as the magnet field, sinc the cross product is zero for two vector that are in the same direction. further, all other orient feel a torqu that twist them toward the direct of magnet field. == interact with electr current == current of electr charg both generat a magnet field and feel a forc due to magnet b-fields. === magnet field due to move charg and electr current === all move charg particl produc magnet fields. move point charges, such as electrons, produc complic but well known magnet field that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceler of the particles.magnet field line form in concentr circl around a cylindr current-carri conductor, such as a length of wire. the direct of such a magnet field can be determin by use the \"right-hand grip rule\" (see figur at right). the strength of the magnet field decreas with distanc from the wire. (for an infinit length wire the strength is invers proport to the distance.) bend a current-carri wire into a loop concentr the magnet field insid the loop while weaken it outside. bend a wire into multipl close space loop to form a coil or \"solenoid\" enhanc this effect. a devic so form around an iron core may act as an electromagnet, generat a strong, well-control magnet field. an infinit long cylindr electromagnet has a uniform magnet field inside, and no magnet field outside. a finit length electromagnet produc a magnet field that look similar to that produc by a uniform perman magnet, with it strength and polar determin by the current flow through the coil. the magnet field generat by a steadi current i (a constant flow of electr charges, in which charg neither accumul nor is deplet at ani point) is describ by the biot\u2013savart law: b = \u03bc i \u03c0 \u222b w i r e d \u2113 \u00d7 r ^ r , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {b} ={\\frac {\\mu }}\\int _{\\mathrm {wire} }{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}\\time \\mathbf {\\hat {r}} where the integr sum over the wire length where vector d\u2113 is the vector line element with direct in the same sens as the current i, is the magnet constant, r is the distanc between the locat of d\u2113 and the locat where the magnet field is calculated, and r\u0302 is a unit vector in the direct of r. for example, in the case of a suffici long, straight wire, this becomes: | b | = \u03bc \u03c0 r i {\\displaystyl |\\mathbf {b} |={\\frac {\\mu r}}i} where r = |r|. the direct is tangent to a circl perpendicular to the wire accord to the right hand rule.a slight more general way of relat the current i {\\displaystyl {i}} to the b-field is through amp\u00e8r law: \u222e b \u22c5 d \u2113 = \u03bc i e n c , {\\displaystyl \\oint \\mathbf {b} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}=\\mu {enc} },} where the line integr is over ani arbitrari loop and i {\\displaystyl {i}} enc is the current enclos by that loop. amp\u00e8r law is alway valid for steadi current and can be use to calcul the b-field for certain high symmetr situat such as an infinit wire or an infinit solenoid. in a modifi form that account for time vari electr fields, amp\u00e8r law is one of four maxwel equat that describ electr and magnetism. === forc on move charg and current === ==== forc on a charg particl ==== a charg particl move in a b-field experi a sideway forc that is proport to the strength of the magnet field, the compon of the veloc that is perpendicular to the magnet field and the charg of the particle. this forc is known as the lorentz force, and is given by f = q e + q v \u00d7 b , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {f} =q\\mathbf {e} +q\\mathbf {v} \\time \\mathbf {b} ,} where f is the force, q is the electr charg of the particle, v is the instantan veloc of the particle, and b is the magnet field (in teslas). the lorentz forc is alway perpendicular to both the veloc of the particl and the magnet field that creat it. when a charg particl move in a static magnet field, it trace a helic path in which the helix axi is parallel to the magnet field, and in which the speed of the particl remain constant. becaus the magnet forc is alway perpendicular to the motion, the magnet field can do no work on an isol charge. it can onli do work indirectly, via the electr field generat by a chang magnet field. it is often claim that the magnet forc can do work to a non-elementari magnet dipole, or to charg particl whose motion is constrain by other forces, but this is incorrect becaus the work in those case is perform by the electr forc of the charg deflect by the magnet field. ==== forc on current-carri wire ==== the forc on a current carri wire is similar to that of a move charg as expect sinc a current carri wire is a collect of move charges. a current-carri wire feel a forc in the presenc of a magnet field. the lorentz forc on a macroscop current is often refer to as the laplac force. consid a conductor of length \u2113, cross section a, and charg q due to electr current i. if this conductor is place in a magnet field of magnitud b that make an angl \u03b8 with the veloc of charg in the conductor, the forc exert on a singl charg q is f = q v b sin \u2061 \u03b8 , {\\displaystyl f=qvb\\sin \\theta ,} so, for n charg where n = n \u2113 a {\\displaystyl n=n\\ell a} ,the forc exert on the conductor is f = f n = q v b n \u2113 a sin \u2061 \u03b8 = b i \u2113 sin \u2061 \u03b8 {\\displaystyl f=fn=qvbn\\ell a\\sin \\theta =bi\\el \\sin \\theta } ,where i = nqva. ==== direct of forc ==== the direct of forc on a charg or a current can be determin by a mnemon known as the right-hand rule (see the figure). use the right hand, point the thumb in the direct of the current, and the finger in the direct of the magnet field, the result forc on the charg point outward from the palm. the forc on a negat charg particl is in the opposit direction. if both the speed and the charg are revers then the direct of the forc remain the same. for that reason a magnet field measur (bi itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a posit charg move to the right or a negat charg move to the left. (both of these case produc the same current.) on the other hand, a magnet field combin with an electr field can distinguish between these, see hall effect below. an altern mnemon to the right hand rule is fleme left-hand rule. == relat between h and b == the formula deriv for the magnet field abov are correct when deal with the entir current. a magnet materi place insid a magnet field, though, generat it own bound current, which can be a challeng to calculate. (this bound current is due to the sum of atom size current loop and the spin of the subatom particl such as electron that make up the material.) the h-field as defin abov help factor out this bound current; but to see how, it help to introduc the concept of magnet first. === magnet === the magnet vector field m repres how strong a region of materi is magnetized. it is defin as the net magnet dipol moment per unit volum of that region. the magnet of a uniform magnet is therefor a materi constant, equal to the magnet moment m of the magnet divid by it volume. sinc the si unit of magnet moment is the si unit of magnet m is amper per meter, ident to that of the h-field. the magnet m field of a region point in the direct of the averag magnet dipol moment in that region. magnet field lines, therefore, begin near the magnet south pole and end near the magnet north pole. (magnet doe not exist outsid the magnet.) in the amperian loop model, the magnet is due to combin mani tini amperian loop to form a result current call bound current. this bound current, then, is the sourc of the magnet b field due to the magnet. (see magnet dipol below and magnet pole vs. atom current for more information.) given the definit of the magnet dipole, the magnet field follow a similar law to that of amper law: \u222e m \u22c5 d \u2113 = i b , {\\displaystyl \\oint \\mathbf {m} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}=i_{\\mathrm {b} },} where the integr is a line integr over ani close loop and ib is the bound current enclos by that close loop. in the magnet pole model, magnet begin at and end at magnet poles. if a given region, therefore, has a net posit \"magnet pole strength\" (correspond to a north pole) then it has more magnet field line enter it than leav it. mathemat this is equival to: \u222e s \u03bc m \u22c5 d a = \u2212 q m {\\displaystyl \\oint _{s}\\mu {m} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {a} =-q_{\\mathrm {m} }} ,where the integr is a close surfac integr over the close surfac s and qm is the \"magnet charge\" (in unit of magnet flux) enclos by s. (a close surfac complet surround a region with no hole to let ani field line escape.) the negat sign occur becaus the magnet field move from south to north. === h-field and magnet materi === in si units, the h-field is relat to the b-field by h \u2261 b \u03bc \u2212 m . {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {h} \\ \\equiv \\ {\\frac {\\mathbf {b} }{\\mu {m} .} in term of the h-field, amper law is \u222e h \u22c5 d \u2113 = \u222e ( b \u03bc \u2212 m ) \u22c5 d \u2113 = i t o t \u2212 i b = i f , {\\displaystyl \\oint \\mathbf {h} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}=\\oint \\left({\\frac {\\mathbf {b} }{\\mu {m} \\right)\\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}=i_{\\mathrm {tot} }-i_{\\mathrm {b} }=i_{\\mathrm {f} },} where if repres the free current enclos by the loop so that the line integr of h doe not depend at all on the bound currents.for the differenti equival of this equat see maxwel equations. amper law lead to the boundari condit ( h \u2225 \u2212 h \u2225 ) = k f \u00d7 n ^ , {\\displaystyl \\left(\\mathbf }} -\\mathbf }} \\right)=\\mathbf {k} _{\\mathrm {f} }\\time {\\hat {\\mathbf {n} }},} where kf is the surfac free current densiti and the unit normal n ^ {\\displaystyl {\\hat {\\mathbf {n} }}} point in the direct from medium to medium a surfac integr of h over ani close surfac is independ of the free current and pick out the \"magnet charges\" within that close surface: \u222e s \u03bc h \u22c5 d a = \u222e s ( b \u2212 \u03bc m ) \u22c5 d a = \u2212 ( \u2212 q m ) = q m , {\\displaystyl \\oint _{s}\\mu {h} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {a} =\\oint _{s}(\\mathbf {b} -\\mu {m} )\\cdot \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {a} {m} })=q_{\\mathrm {m} },} which doe not depend on the free currents. the h-field, therefore, can be separ into two independ parts: h = h + h d , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {h} =\\mathbf {h} {h} _{\\mathrm {d} },\\,} where is the appli magnet field due onli to the free current and hd is the demagnet field due onli to the bound currents. the magnet h-field, therefore, re-factor the bound current in term of \"magnet charges\". the h field line loop onli around \"free current\" and, unlik the magnet b field, begin and end near magnet pole as well. === magnet === most materi respond to an appli b-field by produc their own magnet m and therefor their own b-fields. typically, the respons is weak and exist onli when the magnet field is applied. the term magnet describ how materi respond on the microscop level to an appli magnet field and is use to categor the magnet phase of a material. materi are divid into group base upon their magnet behavior: diamagnet materi produc a magnet that oppos the magnet field. paramagnet materi produc a magnet in the same direct as the appli magnet field. ferromagnet materi and the close relat ferrimagnet materi and antiferromagnet materi can have a magnet independ of an appli b-field with a complex relationship between the two fields. superconductor (and ferromagnet superconductors) are materi that are character by perfect conduct below a critic temperatur and magnet field. they also are high magnet and can be perfect diamagnet below a lower critic magnet field. superconductor often have a broad rang of temperatur and magnet field (the so-nam mix state) under which they exhibit a complex hysteret depend of m on b.in the case of paramagnet and diamagnetism, the magnet m is often proport to the appli magnet field such that: b = \u03bc h , {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {b} =\\mu \\mathbf {h} ,} where \u03bc is a materi depend paramet call the permeability. in some case the permeabl may be a second rank tensor so that h may not point in the same direct as b. these relat between b and h are exampl of constitut equations. however, superconductor and ferromagnet have a more complex b-to-h relation; see magnet hysteresis. == store energi == energi is need to generat a magnet field both to work against the electr field that a chang magnet field creat and to chang the magnet of ani materi within the magnet field. for non-dispers materials, this same energi is releas when the magnet field is destroy so that the energi can be model as be store in the magnet field. for linear, non-dispersive, materi (such that b = \u03bch where \u03bc is frequency-independent), the energi densiti is: u = b \u22c5 h = b \u22c5 b \u03bc = \u03bc h \u22c5 h . {\\displaystyl u={\\frac {\\mathbf {b} \\cdot \\mathbf {h} {\\mathbf {b} \\cdot \\mathbf {b} }}={\\frac {\\mu \\mathbf {h} \\cdot \\mathbf {h} if there are no magnet materi around then \u03bc can be replac by the abov equat cannot be use for nonlinear materials, though; a more general express given below must be used. in general, the increment amount of work per unit volum \u03b4w need to caus a small chang of magnet field \u03b4b is: \u03b4 w = h \u22c5 \u03b4 b . {\\displaystyl \\delta w=\\mathbf {h} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf {b} .} onc the relationship between h and b is known this equat is use to determin the work need to reach a given magnet state. for hysteret materi such as ferromagnet and superconductors, the work need also depend on how the magnet field is created. for linear non-dispers materials, though, the general equat lead direct to the simpler energi densiti equat given above. == relationship with electr field == === faraday law === a chang magnet field, such as a magnet move through a conduct coil, generat an electr field (and therefor tend to drive a current in such a coil). this is known as faraday law and form the basi of mani electr generat and electr motors. mathematically, faraday law is: e = \u2212 d \u03c6 d t , {\\displaystyl {\\mathcal {e}}=-{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\phi }{\\mathrm {d} t}},} where e {\\displaystyl \\scriptstyl {\\mathcal {e}}} is the electromot forc (or emf, the voltag generat around a close loop) and \u03c6 is the magnet flux\u2014th product of the area time the magnet field normal to that area. (this definit of magnet flux is whi b is often refer to as magnet flux density.) the negat sign repres the fact that ani current generat by a chang magnet field in a coil produc a magnet field that oppos the chang in the magnet field that induc it. this phenomenon is known as lenz law. this integr formul of faraday law can be convert into a differenti form, which appli under slight differ conditions. this form is cover as one of maxwel equat below. === maxwel correct to amp\u00e8r law === similar to the way that a chang magnet field generat an electr field, a chang electr field generat a magnet field. this fact is known as maxwel correct to amp\u00e8r law and is appli as an addit term to amper law as given above. this addit term is proport to the time rate of chang of the electr flux and is similar to faraday law abov but with a differ and posit constant out front. (the electr flux through an area is proport to the area time the perpendicular part of the electr field.) the full law includ the correct term is known as the maxwell\u2013amp\u00e8r equation. it is not common given in integr form becaus the effect is so small that it can typic be ignor in most case where the integr form is used. the maxwel term is critic import in the creation and propag of electromagnet waves. maxwel correct to amp\u00e8r law togeth with faraday law of induct describ how mutual chang electr and magnet field interact to sustain each other and thus to form electromagnet waves, such as light: a chang electr field generat a chang magnet field, which generat a chang electr field again. these, though, are usual describ use the differenti form of this equat given below. === maxwel equat === like all vector fields, a magnet field has two import mathemat properti that relat it to it sources. (for b the sourc are current and chang electr fields.) these two properties, along with the two correspond properti of the electr field, make up maxwel equations. maxwel equat togeth with the lorentz forc law form a complet descript of classic electrodynam includ both electr and magnetism. the first properti is the diverg of a vector field a, \u2207 \u00b7 a, which repres how a \"flows\" outward from a given point. as discuss above, a b-field line never start or end at a point but instead form a complet loop. this is mathemat equival to say that the diverg of b is zero. (such vector field are call solenoid vector fields.) this properti is call gauss law for magnet and is equival to the statement that there are no isol magnet pole or magnet monopoles. the electr field on the other hand begin and end at electr charg so that it diverg is non-zero and proport to the charg densiti (see gauss law). the second mathemat properti is call the curl, such that \u2207 \u00d7 a repres how a curl or \"circulates\" around a given point. the result of the curl is call a \"circul source\". the equat for the curl of b and of e are call the amp\u00e8re\u2013maxwel equat and faraday law respectively. they repres the differenti form of the integr equat given above. the complet set of maxwel equat then are: \u2207 \u22c5 b = , \u2207 \u22c5 e = \u03c1 \u03b5 , \u2207 \u00d7 b = \u03bc j + \u03bc \u03b5 \u2202 e \u2202 t , \u2207 \u00d7 e = \u2212 \u2202 b \u2202 t , {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {b} \\cdot \\mathbf {e} &={\\frac {\\rho }{\\varepsilon \\time \\mathbf {b} &=\\mu {j} +\\mu {\\partial \\mathbf {e} }{\\partial t}},\\\\\\nabla \\time \\mathbf {e} &=-{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {b} }{\\partial t}},\\end{aligned}}} where j = complet microscop current densiti and \u03c1 is the charg density. as discuss above, materi respond to an appli electr e field and an appli magnet b field by produc their own intern \"bound\" charg and current distribut that contribut to e and b but are difficult to calculate. to circumv this problem, h and d field are use to re-factor maxwel equat in term of the free current densiti jf and free charg densiti \u03c1f: \u2207 \u22c5 b = , \u2207 \u22c5 d = \u03c1 f , \u2207 \u00d7 h = j f + \u2202 d \u2202 t , \u2207 \u00d7 e = \u2212 \u2202 b \u2202 t . {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {b} \\cdot \\mathbf {d} &=\\rho _{\\mathrm {f} },\\\\\\nabla \\time \\mathbf {h} &=\\mathbf {j} _{\\mathrm {f} }+{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {d} }{\\partial t}},\\\\\\nabla \\time \\mathbf {e} &=-{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {b} }{\\partial t}}.\\end{aligned}}} these equat are not ani more general than the origin equat (if the \"bound\" charg and current in the materi are known). they also must be supplement by the relationship between b and h as well as that between e and d. on the other hand, for simpl relationship between these quantiti this form of maxwel equat can circumv the need to calcul the bound charg and currents. === electr and magnet fields: differ aspect of the same phenomenon === accord to the special theori of relativity, the partit of the electromagnet forc into separ electr and magnet compon is not fundamental, but vari with the observ frame of reference: an electr forc perceiv by one observ may be perceiv by anoth (in a differ frame of reference) as a magnet force, or a mixtur of electr and magnet forces. formally, special relat combin the electr and magnet field into a tensor, call the electromagnet tensor. chang refer frame mix these components. this is analog to the way that special relat mix space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum, and energi into four-momentum. === magnet vector potenti === in advanc topic such as quantum mechan and relat it is often easier to work with a potenti formul of electrodynam rather than in term of the electr and magnet fields. in this representation, the magnet vector potenti a, and the electr scalar potenti \u03c6, are defin such that: b = \u2207 \u00d7 a , e = \u2212 \u2207 \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202 a \u2202 t . {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf {b} &=\\nabla \\time \\mathbf {a} ,\\\\\\mathbf {e} &=-\\nabla \\varphi -{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {a} }{\\partial t}}.\\end{aligned}}} the vector potenti a may be interpret as a general potenti momentum per unit charg just as \u03c6 is interpret as a general potenti energi per unit charge. maxwel equat when express in term of the potenti can be cast into a form that agre with special relat with littl effort. in relat a togeth with \u03c6 form the four-potential, analog to the four-momentum that combin the momentum and energi of a particle. use the four potenti instead of the electromagnet tensor has the advantag of be much simpler\u2014and it can be easili modifi to work with quantum mechanics. === quantum electrodynam === in modern physics, the electromagnet field is understood to be not a classic field, but rather a quantum field; it is repres not as a vector of three number at each point, but as a vector of three quantum oper at each point. the most accur modern descript of the electromagnet interact (and much else) is quantum electrodynam (qed), which is incorpor into a more complet theori known as the standard model of particl physics. in qed, the magnitud of the electromagnet interact between charg particl (and their antiparticles) is comput use perturb theory. these rather complex formula produc a remark pictori represent as feynman diagram in which virtual photon are exchanged. predict of qed agre with experi to an extrem high degre of accuracy: current about (and limit by experiment errors); for detail see precis test of qed. this make qed one of the most accur physic theori construct thus far. all equat in this articl are in the classic approximation, which is less accur than the quantum descript mention here. however, under most everyday circumstances, the differ between the two theori is negligible. == use and exampl == === earth magnet field === the earth magnet field is produc by convect of a liquid iron alloy in the outer core. in a dynamo process, the movement drive a feedback process in which electr current creat electr and magnet field that in turn act on the currents.th field at the surfac of the earth is approxim the same as if a giant bar magnet were posit at the center of the earth and tilt at an angl of about off the rotat axi of the earth (see the figure). the north pole of a magnet compass needl point rough north, toward the north magnet pole. however, becaus a magnet pole is attract to it opposite, the north magnet pole is actual the south pole of the geomagnet field. this confus in terminolog aris becaus the pole of a magnet is defin by the geograph direct it points.earth magnet field is not constant\u2014th strength of the field and the locat of it pole vary. moreover, the pole period revers their orient in a process call geomagnet reversal. the most recent revers occur year ago. === rotat magnet field === the rotat magnet field is a key principl in the oper of alternating-curr motors. a perman magnet in such a field rotat so as to maintain it align with the extern field. this effect was conceptu by nikola tesla, and later util in his and other earli ac (altern current) electr motors. magnet torqu is use to drive electr motors. in one simpl motor design, a magnet is fix to a freeli rotat shaft and subject to a magnet field from an array of electromagnets. by continu switch the electr current through each of the electromagnets, therebi flip the polar of their magnet fields, like pole are kept next to the rotor; the result torqu is transfer to the shaft. a rotat magnet field can be construct use two orthogon coil with degre phase differ in their ac currents. however, in practic such a system would be suppli through a three-wir arrang with unequ currents. this inequ would caus serious problem in standard of the conductor size and so, to overcom it, three-phas system are use where the three current are equal in magnitud and have degre phase difference. three similar coil have mutual geometr angl of degre creat the rotat magnet field in this case. the abil of the three-phas system to creat a rotat field, util in electr motors, is one of the main reason whi three-phas system domin the world electr power suppli systems. synchron motor use dc-voltage-f rotor windings, which let the excit of the machin be controlled\u2014and induct motor use short-circuit rotor (instead of a magnet) follow the rotat magnet field of a multicoil stator. the short-circuit turn of the rotor develop eddi current in the rotat field of the stator, and these current in turn move the rotor by the lorentz force. in nikola tesla identifi the concept of the rotat magnet field. in galileo ferrari independ research the concept. in tesla gain u.s. patent for his work. also in ferrari publish his research in a paper to the royal academi of scienc in turin. === hall effect === the charg carrier of a current-carri conductor place in a transvers magnet field experi a sideway lorentz force; this result in a charg separ in a direct perpendicular to the current and to the magnet field. the result voltag in that direct is proport to the appli magnet field. this is known as the hall effect. the hall effect is often use to measur the magnitud of a magnet field. it is use as well to find the sign of the domin charg carrier in materi such as semiconductor (negat electron or posit holes). === magnet circuit === an import use of h is in magnet circuit where b = \u03bch insid a linear material. here, \u03bc is the magnet permeabl of the material. this result is similar in form to ohm law j = \u03c3e, where j is the current density, \u03c3 is the conduct and e is the electr field. extend this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscop ohm law (i = v\u2044r) is: \u03c6 = f r m , {\\displaystyl \\phi ={\\frac {f}{r}}_{\\mathrm {m} },} where \u03c6 = \u222b b \u22c5 d a {\\displaystyl \\phi =\\int \\mathbf {b} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {a} } is the magnet flux in the circuit, f = \u222b h \u22c5 d \u2113 {\\displaystyl f=\\int \\mathbf {h} \\cdot \\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}} is the magnetomot forc appli to the circuit, and rm is the reluct of the circuit. here the reluct rm is a quantiti similar in natur to resist for the flux. use this analog it is straightforward to calcul the magnet flux of complic magnet field geometries, by use all the avail techniqu of circuit theory. === magnet field shape descript === an azimuth magnet field is one that run east\u2013west. a meridion magnet field is one that run north\u2013south. in the solar dynamo model of the sun, differenti rotat of the solar plasma caus the meridion magnet field to stretch into an azimuth magnet field, a process call the omega-effect. the revers process is call the alpha-effect. a dipol magnet field is one seen around a bar magnet or around a charg elementari particl with nonzero spin. a quadrupol magnet field is one seen, for example, between the pole of four bar magnets. the field strength grow linear with the radial distanc from it longitudin axis. a solenoid magnet field is similar to a dipol magnet field, except that a solid bar magnet is replac by a hollow electromagnet coil magnet. a toroid magnet field occur in a doughnut-shap coil, the electr current spiral around the tube-lik surface, and is found, for example, in a tokamak. a poloid magnet field is generat by a current flow in a ring, and is found, for example, in a tokamak. a radial magnet field is one in which field line are direct from the center outwards, similar to the spoke in a bicycl wheel. an exampl can be found in a loudspeak transduc (driver). a helic magnet field is corkscrew-shaped, and sometim seen in space plasma such as the orion molecular cloud. == histori == === earli develop === while magnet and some properti of magnet were known to ancient societies, the research of magnet field began in when french scholar petrus peregrinus de maricourt map out the magnet field on the surfac of a spheric magnet use iron needles. note the result field line cross at two point he name those point \"poles\" in analog to earth poles. he also articul the principl that magnet alway have both a north and south pole, no matter how fine one slice them.almost three centuri later, william gilbert of colchest replic petrus peregrinus work and was the first to state explicit that earth is a magnet. publish in gilbert work, de magnete, help to establish magnet as a science. === mathemat develop === in john michel state that magnet pole attract and repel in accord with an invers squar law charles-augustin de coulomb experiment verifi this in and state explicit that north and south pole cannot be separated. build on this forc between poles, sim\u00e9on deni poisson creat the first success model of the magnet field, which he present in in this model, a magnet h-field is produc by magnet pole and magnet is due to small pair of north\u2013south magnet poles. three discoveri in challeng this foundat of magnetism. han christian \u00f8rsted demonstr that a current-carri wire is surround by a circular magnet field. then andr\u00e9-mari amp\u00e8r show that parallel wire with current attract one anoth if the current are in the same direct and repel if they are in opposit directions. finally, jean-baptist biot and f\u00e9lix savart announc empir result about the forc that a current-carri long, straight wire exert on a small magnet, determin the forc were invers proport to the perpendicular distanc from the wire to the magnet. laplac later deduc a law of forc base on the differenti action of a differenti section of the wire, which becam known as the biot\u2013savart law, as laplac did not publish his findings.extend these experiments, amp\u00e8r publish his own success model of magnet in in it, he show the equival of electr current to magnet and propos that magnet is due to perpetu flow loop of current instead of the dipol of magnet charg in poisson model. further, amp\u00e8r deriv both amp\u00e8r forc law describ the forc between two current and amp\u00e8r law, which, like the biot\u2013savart law, correct describ the magnet field generat by a steadi current. also in this work, amp\u00e8r introduc the term electrodynam to describ the relationship between electr and magnetism.in michael faraday discov electromagnet induct when he found that a chang magnet field generat an encircl electr field, formul what is now known as faraday law of induction. later, franz ernst neumann prove that, for a move conductor in a magnet field, induct is a consequ of amp\u00e8r forc law. in the process, he introduc the magnet vector potential, which was later shown to be equival to the under mechan propos by faraday.in lord kelvin, then known as william thomson, distinguish between two magnet field now denot h and b. the former appli to poisson model and the latter to amp\u00e8r model and induction. further, he deriv how h and b relat to each other and coin the term permeability.between and jame clerk maxwel develop and publish maxwel equations, which explain and unit all of classic electr and magnetism. the first set of these equat was publish in a paper entitl on physic line of forc in these equat were valid but incomplete. maxwel complet his set of equat in his later paper a dynam theori of the electromagnet field and demonstr the fact that light is an electromagnet wave. heinrich hertz publish paper in and experiment confirm this fact. === modern develop === in tesla develop an induct motor that ran on altern current (ac). the motor use polyphas current, which generat a rotat magnet field to turn the motor (a principl that tesla claim to have conceiv in tesla receiv a patent for his electr motor in may as u.s. patent in galileo ferrari independ research rotat magnet field and subsequ publish his research in a paper to the royal academi of scienc in turin, just two month befor tesla was award his patent, in march twentieth centuri show that classic electrodynam is alreadi consist with special relativity, and extend classic electrodynam to work with quantum mechanics. albert einstein, in his paper of that establish relativity, show that both the electr and magnet field are part of the same phenomena view from differ refer frames. finally, the emerg field of quantum mechan was merg with electrodynam to form quantum electrodynam (qed), which first formal the notion that electromagnet field energi is quantiz in the form of photons. as of octob the largest magnet field produc over a macroscop volum outsid a lab set is kt (vniief in sarov, russia, as of octob the largest magnet field produc in a laboratori over a macroscop volum was kt by research at the univers of tokyo in the largest magnet field produc in a

use in astronomy: in the eclipt coordin system as latitud (\u03b2) and longitud (\u03bb); in the horizon system as altitud (alt) and azimuth (az); and in the equatori coordin system as declin (\u03b4). all are measur in degrees, arcminut and arcseconds. the princip except is right ascens (ra) in equatori coordinates, which is measur in time unit of hours, minutes, and seconds. the arcsecond is also often use to describ small astronom angl such as the angular diamet of planet (e.g. the angular diamet of venus which vari between and the proper motion of stars, the separ of compon of binari star systems, and parallax, the small chang of posit of a star in the cours of a year, or of a solar system bodi as the earth rotates. these small angl may also be written in milliarcsecond (mas), or thousandth of an arcsecond. the unit of distance, the parsec, name from the parallax of one arc second, was develop for such parallax measurements. it is the distanc at which the mean radius of the earth orbit (more precisely, one astronom unit) would subtend an angl of one arcsecond. the esa astrometr satellit gaia, launch in can approxim star posit to microarcsecond (\u00b5as). apart from the sun, the star with the largest angular diamet from earth is r doradus, a red giant with a diamet of becaus of the effect of atmospher blurring, ground-bas telescop will smear the imag of a star to an angular diamet of about in poor condit this increas to or even more. the dwarf planet pluto has proven difficult to resolv becaus it angular diamet is about telescop are not affect by the earth atmospher but are diffract limited. for example, the hubbl space telescop can reach an angular size of star down to about techniqu exist for improv see on the ground. adapt optics, for example, can produc imag around on a m class telescope. === cartographi === minut (\u2032) and second (\u2033) of arc are also use in cartographi and navigation. at sea level one minut of arc along the equat equal exact one geograph mile along the earth equat or approxim one nautic mile metres; miles). a second of arc, one sixtieth of this amount, is rough metr feet). the exact distanc vari along meridian arc or ani other great circl arc becaus the figur of the earth is slight oblat (bulg a third of a percent at the equator). posit are tradit given use degrees, minutes, and second of arc for latitude, the arc north or south of the equator, and for longitude, the arc east or west of the prime meridian. ani posit on or abov the earth refer ellipsoid can be precis given with this method. however, when it is inconveni to use for minut and seconds, posit are frequent express as decim fraction degre to an equal amount of precision. degre given to three decim place of a degree) have about the precis of degrees-minutes-second of a degree) and specifi locat within about metr feet). for navig purpos posit are given in degre and decim minutes, for instanc the needl lighthous is at === properti cadastr survey === relat to cartography, properti boundari survey use the mete and bound system reli on fraction of a degre to describ properti line angl in refer to cardin directions. a boundari \"mete\" is describ with a begin refer point, the cardin direct north or south follow by an angl less than degre and a second cardin direction, and a linear distance. the boundari run the specifi linear distanc from the begin point, the direct of the distanc be determin by rotat the first cardin direct the specifi angl toward the second cardin direction. for example, north west feet would describ a line run from the start point feet in a direct (or away from north toward the west. === firearm === the arcminut is common found in the firearm industri and literature, particular concern the precis of rifles, though the industri refer to it as minut of angl (moa). it is especi popular as a unit of measur with shooter familiar with the imperi measur system becaus moa subtend a circl with a diamet of inch (which is often round to just inch) at yard cm at m or cm at m), a tradit distanc on american target ranges. the subtens is linear with the distance, for example, at yards, moa subtend inches, and at yard moa subtend inches. sinc mani modern telescop sight are adjust in half quarter or eighth moa increments, also known as clicks, zero and adjust are made by count and click per moa respectively. for example, if the point of impact is inch high and inch left of the point of aim at yard (which for instanc could be measur by use a spot scope with a calibr reticle), the scope need to be adjust moa down, and moa right. such adjust are trivial when the scope adjust dial have a moa scale print on them, and even figur the right number of click is relat easi on scope that click in fraction of moa. this make zero and adjust much easier: to adjust a moa scope moa down and moa right, the scope need to be adjust \u00d7 = click down and x = click right to adjust a moa scope moa down and moa right, the scope need to be adjust x = click down and \u00d7 = click right to adjust a moa scope moa down and moa right, the scope need to be adjust x = click down and \u00d7 = click rightanoth common system of measur in firearm scope is the milliradian (mrad). zero an mrad base scope is easi for user familiar with base ten systems. the most common adjust valu in mrad base scope is mrad (which approxim moa). to adjust a mrad scope mrad down and mrad right, the scope need to be adjust click down and click right (which equal approxim and moa respectively).on thing to be awar of is that some moa scopes, includ some higher-end models, are calibr such that an adjust of moa on the scope knob correspond to exact inch of impact adjust on a target at yards, rather than the mathemat correct inches. this is common known as the shooter moa (smoa) or inch per hundr yard (iphy). while the differ between one true moa and one smoa is less than half of an inch even at yards, this error compound signific on longer rang shot that may requir adjust upward of moa to compens for the bullet drop. if a shot requir an adjust of moa or more, the differ between true moa and smoa will add up to inch or more. in competit target shooting, this might mean the differ between a hit and a miss. the physic group size equival to m minut of arc can be calcul as follows: group size = \u00d7 distance. in the exampl previous given, for minut of arc, and substitut inch for yards, \u2248 inches. in metric unit moa at metr \u2248 centimetres. sometimes, a precision-ori firearm perform will be measur in moa. this simpli mean that under ideal condit (i.e. no wind, high-grad ammo, clean barrel, and a stabl mount platform such as a vise or a benchrest use to elimin shooter error), the gun is capabl of produc a group of shot whose center point (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the averag diamet of circl in sever group can be subtend by that amount of arc. for example, a moa rifl should be capable, under ideal conditions, of repeat shoot group at yards. most higher-end rifl are warranti by their manufactur to shoot under a given moa threshold (typic moa or better) with specif ammunit and no error on the shooter part. for example, remington sniper weapon system is requir to shoot moa or better, or be reject from sale by qualiti control. rifl manufactur and gun magazin often refer to this capabl as sub-moa, mean a gun consist shoot group under moa. this mean that a singl group of to shot at yards, or the averag of sever groups, will measur less than moa between the two furthest shot in the group, i.e. all shot fall within moa. if larger sampl are taken (i.e., more shot per group) then group size typic increases, howev this will ultim averag out. if a rifl was truli a moa rifle, it would be just as like that two consecut shot land exact on top of each other as that they land moa apart. for groups, base on confidence, a rifl that normal shoot moa can be expect to shoot group between moa and moa, although the major of these group will be under moa. what this mean in practic is if a rifl that shoot group on averag at yard shoot a group measur inch follow by a group that is inches, this is not statist abnormal.th metric system counterpart of the moa is the milliradian (mrad or mil'), be equal to one of the target range, laid out on a circl that has the observ as centr and the target rang as radius. the number of milliradian on a full such circl therefor alway is equal to \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 regardless the target range. therefore, moa \u2248 mrad. this mean that an object which span mrad on the reticl is at a rang that is in metr equal to the object size in millimetr (e.g. an object of mm subtend mrad is metr away). so there is no convers factor required, contrari to the moa system. a reticl with mark (hash or dots) space with a one mrad apart (or a fraction of a mrad) are collect call a mrad reticle. if the mark are round they are call mil-dots. in the tabl below convers from mrad to metric valu are exact (e.g. mrad equal exact mm at metres), while convers of minut of arc to both metric and imperi valu are approximate. at yard is about inch \u2248 mrad (or mm at m, approxim mm at m) mrad \u2248 so mrad \u2248 mrad equal exact cm at m, or approxim inch at yard === human vision === in humans, vision is the abil to resolv a spatial pattern separ by a visual angl of one minut of arc. a letter subtend minut of arc total. === materi === the deviat from parallel between two surfaces, for instanc in optic engineering, is usual measur in arcminut or arcseconds. in addition, arcsecond are sometim use in rock curv (\u03c9-scan) x ray diffract measur of high-qual epitaxi thin films. === manufactur === some measur devic make use of arcminut and arcsecond to measur angl when the object be measur is too small for direct visual inspection. for instance, a toolmak optic compar will often includ an option to measur in \"minut and

(and the table) the high heat valu have tradit been used, but in mani other countries, the low heat valu are common used. neither the gross heat of combust nor the net heat of combust give the theoret amount of mechan energi (work) that can be obtain from the reaction. (this is given by the chang in gibb free energy, and is around mj/kg for gasoline.) the actual amount of mechan work obtain from fuel (the invers of the specif fuel consumption) depend on the engine. a figur of mj/kg is possibl with a gasolin engine, and mj/kg for a diesel engine. see brake specif fuel consumpt for more information. == fuel effici of motor vehicl == the fuel effici of motor vehicl can be express in more ways: fuel consumpt is the amount of fuel use per unit distance; for example, litr per kilometr km). in this case, the lower the value, the more econom a vehicl is (the less fuel it need to travel a certain distance); this is the measur general use across europ (except the uk, denmark and the netherland - see below), new zealand, australia and canada. also in uruguay, paraguay, guatemala, colombia, china, and madagascar., as also in post-soviet space. fuel economi is the distanc travel per unit volum of fuel used; for example, kilometr per litr (km/l) or mile per gallon (mpg), where mpg (imperial) \u2248 km/l. in this case, the higher the value, the more econom a vehicl is (the more distanc it can travel with a certain volum of fuel). this measur is popular in the us and the uk (mpg), but in europe, india, japan, south korea and latin america the metric unit km/l is use instead.convert from mpg or to km (or vice versa) involv the use of the reciproc function, which is not distributive. therefore, the averag of two fuel economi number give differ valu if those unit are used, becaus one of the function is reciprocal, thus not linear. if two peopl calcul the fuel economi averag of two group of car with differ units, the group with better fuel economi may be one or the other. however, from the point of energi use as a share method of measure, the result shall be the same in both the cases.th formula for convert to mile per us gallon (exact l) from km is x {\\displaystyl \\textstyl {\\frac , where x {\\displaystyl x} is valu of km. for mile per imperi gallon (exact l) the formula is x {\\displaystyl \\textstyl {\\frac . in part of europe, the two standard measur cycl for km\" valu are \"urban\" traffic with speed up to km/h from a cold start, and then \"extra urban\" travel at various speed up to km/h which follow the urban test. a combin figur is also quot show the total fuel consum in divid by the total distanc travel in both tests. a reason modern european supermini and mani mid-siz cars, includ station wagons, may manag motorway travel at km mpg mpg imp) or km in citi traffic mpg mpg imp), with carbon dioxid emiss of around g/km. an averag north american mid-siz car travel mpg (us) km) city, mpg (us) km) highway; a full-siz suv usual travel mpg (us) km) citi and mpg (us) km) highway. pickup truck vari considerably; wherea a cylinder-engin light pickup can achiev mpg km), a full-siz pickup with extend cabin onli travel mpg (us) km) citi and mpg (us) km) highway. the averag fuel economi for all vehicl on the road is higher in europ than the usa becaus the higher cost of fuel chang consum behaviour. in the uk, a gallon of gas without tax would cost but with tax cost in the averag cost in the unit state was consum prefer \"muscl cars\", but choos more fuel effici one when gas price increase.european-built car are general more fuel-effici than us vehicles. while europ has mani higher effici diesel cars, european gasolin vehicl are on averag also more effici than gasoline-pow vehicl in the usa. most european vehicl cite in the csi studi run on diesel engines, which tend to achiev greater fuel effici than gas engines. sell those car in the unit state is difficult becaus of emiss standards, note walter mcmanus, a fuel economi expert at the univers of michigan transport research institute. \"for the most part, european diesel don\u2019t meet u.s. emiss standards\", mcmanus said in anoth reason whi mani european model are not market in the unit state is that labor union object to have the big import ani new foreign built model regardless of fuel economi while lay off worker at home.an exampl of european car capabl of fuel economi is the microcar smart fortwo cdi, which can achiev up to km mpg us) use a turbocharg three-cylind bhp kw) diesel engine. the fortwo is produc by daimler ag and is onli sold by one compani in the unit states. furthermore, the world record in fuel economi of product car is held by the volkswagen group, with special product model (label of the volkswagen lupo and the audi consum as littl as km mpg\u2011imp; mpg\u2011us).diesel engin general achiev greater fuel effici than petrol (gasoline) engines. passeng car diesel engin have energi effici of up to but more typic and petrol engin of up to but more typic that is one of the reason whi diesel have better fuel effici than equival petrol cars. a common margin is more mile per gallon for an effici turbodiesel. for example, the current model skoda octavia, use volkswagen engines, has a combin european fuel effici of mpg\u2011us km) for the bhp kw) petrol engin and mpg\u2011us km) for the bhp kw) \u2014 and heavier \u2014 diesel engine. the higher compress ratio is help in rais the energi efficiency, but diesel fuel also contain approxim more energi per unit volum than gasolin which contribut to the reduc fuel consumpt for a given power output. in the unit state had trucks, and averag mile per us gallon km; mpg\u2011imp). larg trucks, over pound kg), averag mile per us gallon km; mpg\u2011imp). the averag economi of automobil in the unit state in was mile per us gallon km; mpg\u2011imp). by this had increas to mile per us gallon km; mpg\u2011imp). averag fuel economi in the unit state gradual declin until when it reach a low of mile per us gallon km; mpg\u2011imp) and gradual has increas since, as a result of higher fuel cost. a studi indic that a increas in gas price will eventu produc a increas in fuel economy. one method by car maker to increas fuel effici is lightweight in which lighter-weight materi are substitut in for improv engin perform and handling. == fuel effici in micrograv == how fuel combust affect how much energi is produced. the nation aeronaut and space administr (nasa) has investig fuel consumpt in microgravity. the common distribut of a flame under normal graviti condit depend on convection, becaus soot tend to rise to the top of a flame, such as in a candle, make the flame yellow. in micrograv or zero gravity, such as an environ in outer space, convect no longer occurs, and the flame becom spherical, with a tendenc to becom more blue and more efficient. there are sever possibl explan for this difference, of which the most like one given is the hypothesi that the temperatur is even distribut enough that soot is not form and complet combust occurs., nation aeronaut and space administration, april experi by nasa in micrograv reveal that diffus flame in micrograv allow more soot to be complet oxidis after they are produc than diffus flame on earth, becaus of a seri of mechan that behav differ in micrograv when compar to normal graviti experi results, nation aeronaut and space administration, april premix flame in micrograv burn at a much slower rate and more effici than even a candl on earth, and last much longer. == transport == === fuel effici in transport === === vehicl effici and transport pollut === fuel effici direct affect emiss caus pollut by affect the amount of fuel used. however, it also depend on the fuel sourc use to drive the vehicl concerned. car for example, can run on a number of fuel type other than gasoline, such as natur gas, lpg or biofuel or electr which creat various quantiti of atmospher pollution. a kilogram of carbon, whether contain in petrol, diesel, kerosene, or ani other hydrocarbon fuel in a vehicle, lead to approxim kg of emissions. due to the carbon content of gasoline, it combust emit kg/l lb/us gal) of sinc diesel fuel is more energi dens per unit volume, diesel emit kg/l lb/us gal). this figur is onli the emiss of the final fuel product and doe not includ addit emiss creat dure the drilling, pumping, transport and refin step requir to produc the fuel. addit measur to reduc overal emiss includ improv to the effici of air conditioners, light and tires. === drive techniqu === mani driver have the potenti to improv their fuel effici significantly. these five basic fuel-effici drive techniqu can be effective. simpl thing such as keep tire proper inflated, have a vehicl well-maintain and avoid idl can dramat improv fuel efficiency.ther is a grow communiti of enthusiast known as hypermil who develop and practic drive techniqu to increas fuel effici and reduc consumption. hypermil have broken record of fuel efficiency, for example, achiev mile per gallon in a prius. in non-hybrid vehicl these techniqu are also beneficial, with fuel effici of up to mpg\u2011us km) in a honda accord or mpg\u2011us km) in an acura mdx. == advanc technolog improv to improv fuel effici == the most effici machin for convert energi to rotari motion are electr motors, as use in electr vehicles. however, electr is not a primari energi sourc so the effici of the electr product has also to be taken into account. railway train can be power use electricity, deliv through an addit run rail, overhead catenari system or by on-board generat use in diesel-electr locomot as common on the us and uk rail networks. pollut produc from centralis generat of electr is emit at a distant power station, rather than \"on site\". pollut can be reduc by use more railway electrif and low carbon power for electricity. some railways, such as the french sncf and swiss feder railway deriv most, if not of their power, from hydroelectr or nuclear power stations, therefor atmospher pollut from their rail network is veri low. this was reflect in a studi by aea technolog between a eurostar train and airlin journey between london and paris, which show the train on averag emit time less per passenger, than planes, help in part by french nuclear generation. === hydrogen fuel cell === in the future, hydrogen car may be commerci available. toyota is test market hydrogen fuel cell power vehicl in southern california where a seri of hydrogen fuel station has been established. power either through chemic reaction in a fuel cell that creat electr to drive veri effici electr motor or by direct burn hydrogen in a combust engin (near ident to a natur gas vehicle, and similar compat with both natur gas and gasoline); these vehicl promis to have near-zero pollut from the tailpip (exhaust pipe). potenti the atmospher pollut could be minimal, provid the hydrogen is made by electrolysi use electr from non-pollut sourc such as solar, wind or hydroelectr or nuclear. commerci hydrogen product use fossil fuel and produc more carbon dioxid than hydrogen. becaus there are pollut involv in the manufactur and destruct of a car and the production, transmiss and storag of electr and hydrogen, the use of the label \"zero pollution\" should be understood as appli onli to the car convers of store energi into transportation. in a consortium of major auto-mak \u2014 bmw, general motors, honda, toyota and volkswagen/audi \u2014 came up with \"top tier deterg gasolin standard\" to gasolin brand in the us and canada that meet their minimum standard for deterg content and do not contain metal additives. top tier gasolin contain higher level of deterg addit in order to prevent the build-up of deposit (typically, on fuel injector and intak valve) known to reduc fuel economi and engin performance. == see also == == refer == == extern link == us govern websit on fuel economi uk dft comparison on road and rail nasa offer a million prize for a fast and fuel-effici aircraft car fuel consumpt offici figur spritmonitor.d \"the most fuel effici cars\" - databas of thousand of (most german) car owner actual fuel consumpt figur (cf. spritmonitor) searchabl fuel economi data from the epa - unit state environment protect agenc penghemat bbm - alat penghemat bbm ny times: a road test of altern fuel vision",

abandon in the yen becam undervalu and was allow to float. the yen had appreci to a peak of per in then underw period of depreci and appreci due to the oil crisis, arriv at a valu of per by sinc the japanes govern has maintain a polici of currenc intervention, and the yen is therefor under a \"dirti float\" regime. the japanes govern focus on a competit export market, and tri to ensur a low exchang rate for the yen through a trade surplus. the plaza accord of temporarili chang this situation: the exchang rate fell from it averag of per in to in and led to a peak rate of against the u.s. dollar in effect increas the valu of japan\u2019 gdp in us dollar term to almost that of the unit states. sinc that time, however, the world price of the yen has great decreased. the bank of japan maintain a polici of zero to near-zero interest rate and the japanes govern has previous had a strict anti-infl policy. == pronunci and etymolog == yen deriv from the japanes word \u5713 (\u3048\u3093, en, [e\u0274]; lit. \"round\"), which borrow it phonet read from chines yuan, similar to north korean won and south korean won. originally, the chines had trade silver in mass call syce and when spanish and mexican silver coin arriv from the philippines, the chines call them \"silver rounds\" (chinese: \u9280\u5713; pinyin: y\u00ednyu\u00e1n) for their circular shapes. the coin and the name also appear in japan. while the chines eventu replac \u5706; \u5713 with \u5143, the japanes continu to use the same word, which was given the shinjitai form \u5186 in reform at the end of world war ii. the spell and pronunci \"yen\" is standard in english becaus when japan was first encount by european around the century, japanes /e/ (\u3048) and /we/ (\u3091) both had been pronounc [je] and portugues missionari had spell them \"ye\". by the middl of the century, /e/ and /we/ came to be pronounc [e] as in modern japanese, although some region retain the [je] pronunciation. walter henri medhurst, who had neither been to japan nor met ani japanes people, have consult main a japanese-dutch dictionary, spell some \"e\" as \"ye\" in his an english and japanese, and japanes and english vocabulari in the earli meiji era, jame curti hepburn, follow medhurst, spell all \"e\" as \"ye\" in his a japanes and english dictionari in japanese, e and i are slight palatalized, somewhat as in russian. that was the first full-scal japanese-english/english-japanes dictionary, which had a strong influenc on western in japan and probabl prompt the spell \"yen\". hepburn revis most \"ye\" to \"e\" in the edit to mirror the contemporari pronunciation, except \"yen\". this was probabl alreadi fix and has remain so ever since. == histori == === introduct === in the century, silver spanish dollar coin were common throughout the far east such as in southeast asia, china, and japan. these coin had been introduc through manila in the philippin as part of the spanish east indi of the spanish coloni empir over a period of two hundr and fifti years, arriv on ship known as manila galleon in the manila-acapulco galleon trade from acapulco in the viceroyalti of new spain (mexico). until the century, these silver dollar coin were actual spanish silver dollar coin mint in the new world, most from mexico citi and mine in the silver mine of potos\u00ed in bolivia and peru. but from the they were increas replac by silver dollar of the newli independ latin american republics, such as mexico. in the later half of the century, some local coin in the region were made in the resembl of the mexican peso. the first of these local silver coin was the hong kong silver dollar coin that was mint in hong kong between and the chines were slow to accept unfamiliar coinag and prefer the familiar mexican dollars, and so the hong kong govern ceas mint these coin and sold the mint machineri to japan. the japanes then decid to adopt a silver dollar coinag under the name of yen', mean 'a round object'. the yen was offici adopt by the meiji govern in an act sign on june the new currenc was gradual introduc begin from juli of that year. the yen was therefor basic a dollar unit, like all dollars, descend from the spanish piec of eight, and up until all the dollar in the world had more or less the same value. the yen replac tokugawa coinage, a complex monetari system of the edo period base on the mon. the new currenc act of stipul the adopt of the decim account system of yen \u5713), sen \u9322), and rin \u5398), with the coin be round and manufactur use western machinery. the yen was legal defin as troy ounc g) of pure silver, or gram of pure gold (as recommend by the european congress of economist in pari in the coin was equival to the argentin peso fuert coin), henc put it on a bimetal standard. follow the silver devalu of the yen devalu against the u.s. dollar and the canadian dollar (sinc those two countri adher to a gold standard), and by the yen was worth onli about in that year, japan adopt a gold exchang standard and henc froze the valu of the yen at this exchang rate remain in place until japan left the gold standard in decemb after which the yen fell to by juli and to by it remain steadi at around until the start of the pacif war on decemb at which time it fell to sen and the rin were eventu taken out of circul at the end of === fix valu of the yen to the u.s. dollar === no true exchang rate exist for the yen between decemb and april wartim inflat reduc the yen to a fraction of it pre-war value. after a period of instability, on april the u.s. occup govern fix the valu of the yen at per through a unit state plan, which was part of the bretton wood system, to stabil price in the japanes economy. that exchang rate was maintain until when the unit state abandon the gold standard, which had been a key element of the bretton wood system, and impos a percent surcharg on imports, set in motion chang that eventu led to float exchang rate in === undervalu yen === by the yen had becom undervalued. japanes export were cost too littl in intern markets, and import from abroad were cost the japanes too much. this undervalu was reflect in the current account balance, which had risen from the deficit of the earli to a then-larg surplus of billion in the belief that the yen, and sever other major currencies, were undervalu motiv the unit state action in === yen and major currenc float === follow the unit state measur to devalu the dollar in the summer of the japanes govern agre to a new, fix exchang rate as part of the smithsonian agreement, sign at the end of the year. this agreement set the exchang rate at per however, the new fix rate of the smithsonian agreement were difficult to maintain in the face of suppli and demand pressur in the foreign-exchang market. in earli the rate were abandoned, and the major nation of the world allow their currenc to float. === japanes govern intervent in the currenc market === in the japanes govern and busi peopl were veri concern that a rise in the valu of the yen would hurt export growth by make japanes product less competit and would damag the industri base. the govern therefor continu to interven heavili in foreign-exchang market (buy or sell dollars), even after the decis to allow the yen to float.despit intervention, market pressur caus the yen to continu climb in value, peak temporarili at an averag of per in befor the impact of the oil crisi was felt. the increas cost of import oil caus the yen to depreci to a rang of per to per between and the re-emerg of trade surplus drove the yen back up to in this currenc strengthen was again revers by the second oil shock in with the yen drop to per by === yen in the earli === dure the first half of the the yen fail to rise in valu even though current account surplus return and grew quickly. from per in the averag valu of the yen actual drop to per in the rise in the current account surplus generat stronger demand for yen in foreign-exchang markets, but this trade-rel demand for yen was offset by other factors. a wide differenti in interest rates, with unit state interest rate much higher than those in japan, and the continu move to deregul the intern flow of capital, led to a larg net outflow of capit from japan. this capit flow increas the suppli of yen in foreign-exchang markets, as japanes investor chang their yen for other currenc (main dollars) to invest overseas. this kept the yen weak relat to the dollar and foster the rapid rise in the japanes trade surplus that took place in the === effect of the plaza accord === in a dramat chang began. financ offici from major nation sign an agreement (the plaza accord) affirm that the dollar was overvalu (and, therefore, the yen undervalued). this agreement, and shift suppli and demand pressur in the markets, led to a rapid rise in the valu of the yen. from it averag of per in the yen rose to a peak of in virtual doubl it valu relat to the dollar. after declin somewhat in and it reach a new high of to in decemb in april the yen hit a peak of under yen per dollar, temporarili make japan economi near the size of that of the us. === post-bubbl year === the yen declin dure the japanes asset price bubbl and continu to do so afterwards, reach a low of to in februari the bank of japan polici of zero interest rate has discourag yen investments, with the carri trade of investor borrow yen and invest in better-pay currenc (thus further push down the yen) estim to be as larg as trillion. in februari the economist estim that the yen was undervalu against the dollar, and as much as undervalu against the euro. === after the global econom crisi of === however, this trend of depreci revers after the global econom crisi of other major currencies, except the swiss franc, have been declin relat to the yen. on april the bank of japan announc that they would expand their asset purchas program by trillion in two years. the bank of japan hope to bring japan from deflat to inflation, aim for inflation. the amount of purchas is so larg that it is expect to doubl the money supply. but this move has spark concern that the author in japan are deliber devalu the yen in order to boost exports. however, the commerci sector in japan worri that the devalu would trigger an increas in import prices, especi for energi and raw materials. ==

currency, risk fall behind china and risk it domin in the global financi system. victor shih, a china expert and professor at the univers of california san diego, said that mere introduc a digit currenc \"doesn't solv the problem that some peopl hold renminbi offshor will want to sell that renminbi and exchang it for the dollar\", as the dollar is consid to be a safer asset. eswar prasad, an econom professor at cornel university, said that the digit renminbi \"will hard put a dent in the dollar status as the domin global reserv currency\" due to the unit state \"econom dominance, deep and liquid capit markets, and still-robust institut framework\". the u.s. dollar share as a reserv currenc is abov while that of the renminbi is about april the guardian report that the digit currenc e-rmb had been adopt into multipl citi monetari system and \"some govern employe and public servant [will] receiv their salari in the digit currenc from may. the guardian quot a china daili report which state \"a sovereign digit currenc provid a function altern to the dollar settlement system and blunt the impact of ani sanction or threat of exclus both at a countri and compani level ... it may also facilit integr into global trade currenc market with a reduc risk of polit inspir disruption.\" there are talk of test out the digit rmb in the upcom beij winter olymp in but china overal timet for roll out the digit currenc is unclear. == issuanc == as of renminbi banknot are avail in denomin from and jiao), and these denomin have been avail sinc except for the and yuan note (ad in coin are

urban areas, and small note be more popular in rural areas. older fen and larg jiao coin are uncommon still seen in circul but are still valid in exchange. === banknot === as of there have been five seri of renminbi banknot issu by the peopl republ of china: the first seri of renminbi banknot was issu on decemb by the newli found peopl bank of china. it introduc note in denomin of and yuan. note for and yuan follow in with yuan note ad in a total of differ design were issued. the note were offici withdrawn on various date between april and may the name \"first series\" was given retroact in after work began to design a new series.thes first renminbi note were print with the word \"peopl bank of china\", \"republ of china\", and the denomination, written in chines charact by dong biwu.th second seri of renminbi banknot was introduc on march (but date each note has the word \"peopl bank of china\" as well as the denomin in the uyghur, tibetan, mongolian and zhuang languag on the back, which has sinc appear in each seri of renminbi notes. the denomin avail in banknot were and except for the three fen denomin and the yuan which were withdrawn, note in these denomin continu to circulate. good exampl of this seri have gain high status with banknot collectors. the third seri of renminbi banknot was introduc on april though mani denomin were date new date would be issu as stock of older date were gradual depleted. the size and design layout of the note had chang but not the order of color for each denomination. for the next two decades, the second and third seri banknot were use concurrently. the denomin were of and the third seri was phase out dure the and then was recal complet on juli the fourth seri of renminbi banknot was introduc between and although the banknot were date or they were withdrawn from circul in may banknot are avail in denomin of and like previous issues, the color design for alreadi exist denomin remain in effect. the fifth seri of renminbi banknot and coin was progress introduc from it introduct in this seri also bear the issu year (all except only) and and as of it includ banknot for and significantly, the fifth seri use the portrait of chines communist parti chairman mao zedong on all banknotes, in place of the various leaders, worker and represent of china ethnic group which had been featur previously. dure this seri new secur featur were added, the denomin was discontinued, the color pattern for each note was chang and a new denomin of was introduc for this series. a revis seri of coin of and and banknot of and were issu for general circul on august the banknot of the fifth seri will be issu with new print technolog in a bid to reduc counterfeit of chines currency, and will be issu for circul in novemb === commemor issu of the renminbi === in a commemor red note was issu in honor of the anniversari of the establish of the peopl republ of china. this note featur chines communist parti chairman mao zedong on the front and various anim on the back. an orang polym note, and so far, china onli polym note, commemor the new millennium was issu in with a face valu of this featur a dragon on the obvers and the revers featur the china millennium monument (at the center for cultur and scientif fairs). for the beij olympics, a green note was issu featur the bird nest stadium on the front with the back show a classic olymp discus thrower and various other athletes. on novemb the peopl bank of china issu a blue commemor note to commemor aerospac scienc and technology.in commemor of the anniversari of the issuanc of the renminbi, the peopl bank of china issu million banknot on decemb === use in ethnic minor region of china === the renminbi yuan has differ name when use in ethnic minor region of china. when use in inner mongolia and other mongol autonomies, a yuan is call a tugreg (mongolian: \u1832\u1826\u182d\u1826\u1837\u1822\u182d\u180c, \u0442\u0473\u0433\u0440\u0473\u0433 t\u00fcg\u00fcrig). however, when use in the republ of mongolia, it is still name yuani (mongolian: \u044e\u0430\u043d\u044c) to differenti it from mongolian t\u00f6gr\u00f6g (mongolian: \u0442\u04e9\u0433\u0440\u04e9\u0433). one chines t\u00fcg\u00fcrig (tugreg) is divid into m\u00f6ngg\u00fc (mongolian: \u182e\u1825\u1829\u182d\u1826, \u043c\u04e9\u043d\u0433\u04e9), one chines jiao is label m\u00f6ngg\u00fc\". in mongolian, renminbi is call aradin jogo or arad-un jogo (mongolian: \u1820\u1837\u1820\u1833 \u1824\u1828 \u1835\u1823\u182d\u1823\u1830, \u0430\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0437\u043e\u043e\u0441 arad-un \u01f0o\u03b3os). when use in tibet and other tibetan autonomies, a yuan is call a gor (tibetan: \u0f66\u0f92\u0f7c\u0f62\u0f0b, zypy: gor). one gor is divid into gorsur (tibetan: \u0f66\u0f92\u0f7c\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f5f\u0f74\u0f62\u0f0b, zypy: gorsur) or gar (tibetan: \u0f66\u0f90\u0f62\u0f0b, zypy: gar). in tibetan, renminbi is call mimangxogng\u00fc (tibetan:

xinjiang, the renminbi is call xelq puli (uighur: \u062e\u06d5\u0644\u0642 \u067e\u06c7\u0644\u0649) === product and mint === renminbi currenc product is carri out by a state own corporation, china banknot print and mint corpor (cbpmc; \u4e2d\u56fd\u5370\u949e\u9020\u5e01\u603b\u516c\u53f8) headquart in beijing. cbpmc use sever printing, engrav and mint facil around the countri to produc banknot and coin for subsequ distribution. banknot print facil are base in beijing, shanghai, chengdu, xi'an, shijiazhuang, and nanchang. mint are locat in nanjing, shanghai, and shenyang. also, high grade paper for the banknot is produc at two facil in baod and kunshan. the baod facil is the largest facil in the world dedic to develop banknot materi accord to it website. in addition, the peopl bank of china has it own print technolog research divis that research new techniqu for creat banknot and make counterfeit more difficult. === suggest futur design === on march some deleg to an advisori bodi at the nation peopl congress propos to includ sun yat-sen and deng xiaop on the renminbi banknotes. however, the propos was not adopted. == econom == === valu === for most of it earli history, the rmb was peg to the u.s. dollar at per usd. dure the it was revalu until it reach per usd in when china economi gradual open in the the rmb was devalu in order to improv the competit of chines exports. thus, the offici exchang rate increas from in to by (the lowest rate on record). improv current account balanc dure the latter half of the enabl the chines govern to maintain a peg of per usd from to the rmb reach a record high exchang valu of to the u.s. dollar on januari chines leadership have been rais the yuan to tame inflation, a step u.s. offici have push for year to lower the massiv trade deficit with china. strengthen the valu of the rmb also fit with the chines transit to a more consumer-l econom growth model.in the peopl bank of china again devalu their countri currency. as of septemb the exchang rate for is === depeg from the u.s. dollar === on juli the peg was final lifted, which saw an immedi one-tim rmb revalu to per usd. the exchang rate against the euro stood at per euro. howev the peg was reinstitut unoffici when the financi crisi hit: \"under intens pressur from washington, china took small step to allow it currenc to strengthen for three year start in juli but china re-peg it currenc to the dollar as the financi crisi intensifi in juli june the peopl bank of china releas a statement simultan in chines and english claim that they would \"proce further with reform of the rmb exchang rate regim and increas the rmb exchang rate flexibility\". the news was greet with prais by world leader includ barack obama, nicola sarkozi and stephen harper. the pboc maintain there would be no \"larg swings\" in the currency. the rmb rose to it highest level in five year and market worldwid surg on monday, june follow china announcement.in august joseph adinolfi, a report for marketwatch, report that china had re-peg the rmb. in his article, he narrat that \"weak trade data out of china, releas over the weekend, weigh on the currenc of australia and new zealand on monday. but the yuan didn\u2019t budge. indeed, the chines currency, also known as the renminbi, has been remark steadi over the past month despit the huge selloff in china\u2019 stock market and a spate of disappoint econom data. market strategists, includ simon derrick, chief currenc strategist at bni mellon, and marc chandler, head currenc strategist at brown brother harriman, said that is becaus china polici maker have effect re-peg the yuan. \u201cwhen i look at the dollar-renminbi right now, that look like a fix exchang rate again. they\u2019v re-peg it,\u201d chandler said.\" === manag float === the rmb has now move to a manag float exchang rate base on market suppli and demand with refer to a basket of foreign currencies. in juli the daili trade price of the u.s. dollar against the rmb in the inter-bank foreign exchang market was allow to float within a narrow band of around the central pariti publish by the peopl bank of china; in a later announc publish on may the band was extend to on april the band was extend to on march the band was extend to china has state that the basket is domin by the unit state dollar, euro, japanes yen and south korean won, with a smaller proport made up of the british pound, thai baht, russian ruble, australian dollar, canadian dollar and singapor dollar.on april it trade at per us dollar, which was the first time in more than a decad that a dollar had bought less than seven yuan, and at yuan per euro. begin in januari chines and non-chines citizen have an annual exchang limit of a maximum of currenc exchang will onli proceed if the applic appear in person at the relev bank and present their passport or chines id. currenc exchang transact are central registered. the maximum dollar withdraw is per day, the maximum purchas limit of usd is per day. this stringent manag of the currenc lead to a bottled-up demand for exchang in both directions. it is view as a major tool to keep the currenc peg, prevent inflow of \"hot money\". a shift of chines reserv into the currenc of their other trade partner has caus these nation to shift more of their reserv into dollars, lead to no great chang in the valu of the renminbi against the dollar. === futur market === renminbi futur are trade at the chicago mercantil exchange. the futur are cash-settl at the exchang rate publish by the peopl bank of china. === purchas power pariti === scholar studi suggest that the yuan is undervalu on the basi of purchas power pariti analysis. one studi suggest a undervaluation. the world bank estim that, by purchas power parity, one intern dollar was equival to approxim in the intern monetari fund estim that, by purchas power parity, one intern dollar was equival to approxim in in in in in in in in and in peopl bank of china lower the renminbi daili fix to the us dollar by per cent to on august the peopl bank of china again lower the renminbi daili fix to the us dollar from to after the brexit on june it had not been this low sinc decemb === internation === befor the chines renminbi had littl to no exposur in the intern market becaus of strict govern control by the central chines govern that prohibit almost all export of the currency, or use of it in intern transactions. transact between chines compani and a foreign entiti were general denomin in us dollars. with chines compani unabl to hold us dollar and foreign compani unabl to hold chines yuan, all transact would go through the peopl bank of china. onc the sum was paid by the foreign parti in dollars, the central bank would pass the settlement in renminbi to the chines compani at the state-control exchang rate. in june the chines offici announc a pilot scheme where busi and trade transact were allow between limit busi in guangdong provinc and shanghai, and onli counterparti in hong kong, macau, and select asean nations. prove a success, the program was further extend to chines provinc and counterparti intern in juli and in septemb it was announc that the remain chines provinc would be included. in step intend to establish the renminbi as an intern reserv currency, china has agreement with russia, vietnam, sri lanka, thailand, and japan, allow trade with those countri to be settl direct in renminbi instead of requir convers to us dollars, with australia and south africa to follow soon. === intern reserv currenc === currenc restrict regard renminbi-denomin bank deposit and financi product were great liber in juli in renminbi-denomin bond were report to have been purchas by malaysia central bank and that mcdonald had issu renminbi denomin corpor bond through standard charter bank of hong kong. such liber allow the yuan to look more attract as it can be held with higher return on invest yields, wherea previous that yield was virtual none. nevertheless, some nation bank such as bank of thailand (bot) have express a serious concern about rmb sinc bot cannot substitut the deprec us dollar in it billion foreign exchang reserv for renminbi as much as it wish because: the chines govern has not taken full respons and commit on econom affair at global levels. renminbi still has not becom well-liquid (fulli convertible) yet. the chines govern still lack deep and wide vision about how to perform fund-rais to handl intern loan at global levels.to meet imf requirements, china gave up some of it tight control over the currency.countri that are left-lean in the polit spectrum had alreadi begun to use the renminbi as an altern reserv currenc to the unit state dollar; the central bank of chile report in to have million worth of renminbi in reserves, and the presid of the central bank of venezuela, nelson merentes, made statement in favour of the renminbi follow the announc of reserv withdraw from europ and the unit states.in africa, the central bank of ghana, nigeria, and south africa either hold rmb as a reserv currenc or have taken step to purchas bond denomin in rmb.the \"report on the internation of rmb in which was releas by the peopl bank of china in august said that rmb function as intern reserv currenc has gradual emerged. in the first quarter the share of rmb in global foreign exchang reserv rose to a record high. as of the end of the peopl bank of china has set up rmb clear bank in countri and region outsid of mainland china, which has made the use of rmb more secur and transact cost have decreased. === use as a currenc outsid mainland china === the two special administr regions, hong kong and macau, have their own respect currencies, accord to the \"one country, two systems\" principl and the basic law of the two territories. therefore, the hong kong dollar and the macanes pataca remain the legal tender in the two territories, and renminbi, although sometim accepted, is not legal tender. bank in hong kong allow peopl to maintain account in rmb. becaus of chang in legisl in juli mani bank around the world are now slowli offer individu the chanc to hold deposit in chines renminbi. the rmb had a presenc in macau even befor the return to the peopl republ of china from portugal. bank in macau can issu credit card base on the renminbi, but not loans. renminbi-bas credit card cannot be use in macau casinos.th republ of china, which govern taiwan, believ wide usag of the renminbi would creat an underground economi and undermin it sovereignty. tourist are allow to bring in up to when visit taiwan. these renminbi must be convert to the new taiwan dollar at trial exchang site in matsu and kinmen. the chen shui-bian administr insist that it would not allow full convert until the mainland sign a bilater foreign exchang settlement agreement, though presid ma ying-jeou has pledg to allow full convert as soon as possible. the renminbi circul in some of china neighbors, such as pakistan, mongolia and northern thailand. cambodia welcom the renminbi as an offici currenc and lao and myanmar allow it in border provinc such as wa and kokang and econom zone like mandalay. though unofficial, vietnam recogn the exchang of the renminbi to the \u0111\u1ed3ng. in billion was circul in indonesia. in a bilater currenc swap agreement was made by the bank of indonesia and the bank of china which simplifi busi transactions, and in about of indonesia\u2019 global trade was in renminbi.sinc rmb-nomin bond have been issu outsid mainland china; these are colloqui call \"dim sum bonds\". in april the first initi public offer denomin in renminbi occur in hong kong, when the chines properti invest trust hui xian reit rais billion billion) in it ipo. beij has allow renminbi-denomin financi market to develop in hong kong as part of the effort to internationalis the renminbi. there is limit (under issu of renminbi bond in indonesia. === other market === sinc currenc flow in and out of mainland china are still restricted, rmb trade in off-shor markets, such as the hong kong market, can have a differ valu to rmb trade on the mainland. the offshor rmb market is usual denot as cnh, but there is anoth rmb interbank and spot market in taiwan for domest trade known as cnt. other rmb market includ the dollar-settl non-deliver forward (ndf), and the

rather, they depend on how quick the shear occurs. viscos is the materi properti which relat the viscous stress in a materi to the rate of chang of a deform (the strain rate). although it appli to general flows, it is easi to visual and defin in a simpl shear flow, such as a planar couett flow. in the couett flow, a fluid is trap between two infinit larg plates, one fix and one in parallel motion at constant speed u {\\displaystyl u} (see illustr to the right). if the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steadi state the fluid particl move parallel to it, and their speed vari from {\\displaystyl at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. each layer of fluid move faster than the one just below it, and friction between them give rise to a forc resist their relat motion. in particular, the fluid appli on the top plate a forc in the direct opposit to it motion, and an equal but opposit forc on the bottom plate. an extern forc is therefor requir in order to keep the top plate move at constant speed. in mani fluids, the flow veloc is observ to vari linear from zero at the bottom to u {\\displaystyl u} at the top. moreover, the magnitud f {\\displaystyl f} of the forc act on the top plate is found to be proport to the speed u {\\displaystyl u} and the area a {\\displaystyl a} of each plate, and invers proport to their separ y {\\displaystyl y} : f = \u03bc a u y . {\\displaystyl f=\\mu a{\\frac {u}{y}}.} the proport factor \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is the dynam viscos of the fluid, with unit of pa \u22c5 s {\\displaystyl {\\text{pa}}\\cdot {\\text{s}}} (pascal-second), often simpli refer to as the viscosity. the ratio u / y {\\displaystyl u/y} is call the rate of shear deform or shear velocity, and is the deriv of the fluid speed in the direct perpendicular to the plate (see illustr to the right). if the veloc doe not vari linear with y {\\displaystyl y} , then the appropri general is: \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y , {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}},} where \u03c4 = f / a {\\displaystyl \\tau =f/a} , and \u2202 u / \u2202 y {\\displaystyl \\partial u/\\parti y} is the local shear velocity. this express is refer to as newton law of viscosity. in shear flow with planar symmetry, it is what defin \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is a special case of the general definit of viscos (see below), which can be express in coordinate-fre form. use of the greek letter mu ( \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } ) for the dynam viscos (sometim also call the absolut viscosity) is common among mechan and chemic engineers, as well as mathematician and physicists. however, the greek letter eta ( \u03b7 {\\displaystyl \\eta } ) is also use by chemists, physicists, and the iupac. the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is sometim also call the shear viscosity. however, at least one author discourag the use of this terminology, note that \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } can appear in nonshear flow in addit to shear flows. === general definit === in veri general terms, the viscous stress in a fluid are defin as those result from the relat veloc of differ fluid particles. as such, the viscous stress must depend on spatial gradient of the flow velocity. if the veloc gradient are small, then to a first approxim the viscous stress depend onli on the first deriv of the velocity. (for newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) in cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as \u03c4 i j = \u2211 k \u2211 \u2113 \u03bc i j k \u2113 \u2202 v k \u2202 r \u2113 , {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}=\\sum _{k}\\sum _{\\ell }\\mu _{ijk\\el }{\\frac {\\partial v_{k}}{\\partial r_{\\ell }}},} where \u03bc i j k \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijk\\el }} is a viscos tensor that map the veloc gradient tensor \u2202 v k / \u2202 r \u2113 {\\displaystyl \\partial v_{k}/\\partial r_{\\ell }} onto the viscous stress tensor \u03c4 i j {\\displaystyl \\tau _{ij}} . sinc the indic in this express can vari from to there are \"viscos coefficients\" \u03bc i j k l {\\displaystyl \\mu _{ijkl}} in total. however, assum that the viscos tensor is isotrop reduc these coeffici to three independ paramet \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , \u03b2 {\\displaystyl \\beta } , \u03b3 {\\displaystyl \\gamma } : \u03bc i j k \u2113 = \u03b1 \u03b4 i j \u03b4 k \u2113 + \u03b2

-\\kappa \\right)(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} )\\mathbf {\\delta } ,} where \u03b4 {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {\\delta } } is the unit tensor, and the dagger \u2020 {\\displaystyl \\dagger } denot the transpose. this equat can be thought of as a general form of newton law of viscosity. the bulk viscos (also call volum viscosity) express a type of intern friction that resist the shearless compress or expans of a fluid. knowledg of \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is frequent not necessari in fluid dynam problems. for example, an incompress fluid satisfi \u2207 \u22c5 v = {\\displaystyl \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {v} and so the term contain \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } drop out. moreover, \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } is often assum to be neglig for gase sinc it is {\\displaystyl in a monatom ideal gas. one situat in which \u03ba {\\displaystyl \\kappa } can be import is the calcul of energi loss in sound and shock waves, describ by stoke law of sound attenuation, sinc these phenomena involv rapid expans and compressions. it is worth emphas that the abov express are not fundament law of nature, but rather definit of viscosity. as such, their util for ani given material, as well as mean for measur or calcul the viscosity, must be establish use separ means. === kinemat viscos === in fluid dynamics, it is sometim more conveni to work in term of the kinemat viscos (sometim also call the momentum diffusivity), defin as the ratio of the viscos \u03bc to the densiti of the fluid \u03c1. it is usual denot by the greek letter nu (\u03bd) and has dimens ( l e n g t h ) / t i m e {\\displaystyl \\mathrm } : \u03bd = \u03bc \u03c1 , {\\displaystyl \\nu ={\\frac {\\mu }{\\rho }},} in order to distinguish it from the dynam viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which has dimens f o r c e \u00d7 t i m e / a r e a {\\displaystyl \\mathrm {force\\tim time/area} } . == momentum transport == transport theori provid an altern interpret of viscos in term of momentum transport: viscos is the materi properti which character momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conduct character heat transport, and (mass) diffus character mass transport. to see this, note that in newton law of viscosity, \u03c4 = \u03bc ( \u2202 u / \u2202 y ) {\\displaystyl \\tau =\\mu (\\partial u/\\parti y)} , the shear stress \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } has unit equival to a momentum flux, i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. thus, \u03c4 {\\displaystyl \\tau } can be interpret as specifi the flow of momentum in the y {\\displaystyl y} direct from one fluid layer to the next. per newton law of viscosity, this momentum flow occur across a veloc gradient, and the magnitud of the correspond momentum flux is determin by the viscosity. the analog with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. just as heat flow from high temperatur to low temperatur and mass flow from high densiti to low density, momentum flow from high veloc to low velocity. these behavior are all describ by compact expressions, call constitut relations, whose one-dimension form are given here: j = \u2212 d \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202 x (fick law of diffusion) q = \u2212 k t \u2202 t \u2202 x (fourier law of heat conduction) \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2202 u \u2202 y (newton law of viscosity) {\\displaystyl {\\begin{aligned}\\mathbf {j} &=-d{\\frac {\\partial \\rho }{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fick law of {q} &=-k_{t}{\\frac {\\partial t}{\\partial x}}&&{\\text{(fouri law of heat &=\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\parti y}}&&{\\text{(newton law of viscosity)}}\\end{aligned}}} where \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } is the density, j {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {j} } and q {\\displaystyl \\mathbf {q} } are the mass and heat fluxes, and d {\\displaystyl d} and k t {\\displaystyl k_{t}} are the mass diffus and thermal conductivity. the fact that mass, momentum, and energi (heat) transport are among the most relev process in continuum mechan is not a coincidence: these are among the few physic quantiti that are conserv at the microscop level in interparticl collisions. thus, rather than be dictat by the fast and complex microscop interact timescale, their dynam occur on macroscop timescales, as describ by the various equat of transport theori and hydrodynamics. == newtonian and non-newtonian fluid == newton law of viscos is not a fundament law of nature, but rather a constitut equat (like hook law, fick law, and ohm law) which serv to defin the viscos \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it form is motiv by experi which show that for a wide rang of fluids, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is independ of strain rate. such fluid are call newtonian. gases, water, and mani common liquid can be consid newtonian in ordinari condit and contexts. however, there are mani non-newtonian fluid that signific deviat from this behavior. for example: shear-thicken liquids, whose viscos increas with the rate of shear strain. shear-thin liquids, whose viscos decreas with the rate of shear strain. thixotrop liquids, that becom less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. rheopect (dilatant) liquids, that becom more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwis stressed. bingham plastic that behav as a solid at low stress but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.trouton ratio is the ratio of extension viscos to shear viscosity. for a newtonian fluid, the trouton ratio is shear-thin liquid are veri commonly, but misleadingly, describ as thixotropic.even for a newtonian fluid, the viscos usual depend on it composit and temperature. for gase and other compress fluids, it depend on temperatur and vari veri slowli with pressure. the viscos of some fluid may depend on other factors. a magnetorheolog fluid, for example, becom thicker when subject to a magnet field, possibl to the point of behav like a solid. == in solid == the viscous forc that aris dure fluid flow must not be confus with the elast forc that aris in a solid in respons to shear, compress or extens stresses. while in the latter the stress is proport to the amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proport to the rate of deform over time. for this reason, maxwel use the term fugit elast for fluid viscosity. however, mani liquid (includ water) will briefli react like elast solid when subject to sudden stress. conversely, mani \"solids\" (even granite) will flow like liquids, albeit veri slowly, even under arbitrarili small stress. such materi are therefor best describ as possess both elast (reaction to deformation) and viscos (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, be viscoelastic. viscoelast solid may exhibit both shear viscos and bulk viscosity. the extension viscos is a linear combin of the shear and bulk viscos that describ the reaction of a solid elast materi to elongation. it is wide use for character polymers. in geology, earth materi that exhibit viscous deform at least three order of magnitud greater than their elast deform are sometim call rheids. == measur == viscos is measur with various type of viscomet and rheometers. a rheomet is use for fluid that cannot be defin by a singl valu of viscos and therefor requir more paramet to be set and measur than is the case for a viscometer. close temperatur control of the fluid is essenti to obtain accur measurements, particular in materi like lubricants, whose viscos can doubl with a chang of onli \u00b0c.for some fluids, the viscos is constant over a wide rang of shear rate (newtonian fluids). the fluid without a constant viscos (non-newtonian fluids) cannot be describ by a singl number. non-newtonian fluid exhibit a varieti of differ correl between shear stress and shear rate. one of the most common instrument for measur kinemat viscos is the glass capillari viscometer. in coat industries, viscos may be measur with a cup in which the efflux time is measured. there are sever sort of cup \u2013 such as the zahn cup and the ford viscos cup \u2013 with the usag of each type vari main accord to the industry. the efflux time can also be convert to kinemat viscos (centistokes, cst) through the convers equations. also use in coatings, a stormer viscomet use load-bas rotat in order to determin viscosity. the viscos is report in kreb unit (ku), which are uniqu to stormer viscometers. vibrat viscomet can also be use to measur viscosity. resonant, or vibrat viscomet work by creat shear wave within the liquid. in this method, the sensor is submerg in the fluid and is made to reson at a specif frequency. as the surfac of the sensor shear through the liquid, energi is lost due to it viscosity. this dissip energi is then measur and convert into a viscos reading. a higher viscos caus a greater loss of energy.extension viscos can be measur with various rheomet that appli extension stress. volum viscos can be measur with an acoust rheometer. appar viscos is a calcul deriv from test perform on drill fluid use in oil or gas well development. these calcul and test help engin develop and maintain the properti of the drill fluid to the specif required. nanoviscos (viscos sens by nanoprobes) can be measur by fluoresc correl spectroscopy. == unit == the si unit of dynam viscos is the newton-second per squar meter also frequent express in the equival form pascal-second (pa\u00b7s) and kilogram per meter per second the cgs unit is the pois (p, or = pa\u00b7s), name after jean l\u00e9onard mari poiseuille. it is common expressed, particular in astm standards, as centipois (cp), becaus it is more conveni (for instanc the viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cp), and one centipois is equal to the si millipasc second (mpa\u00b7s). the si unit of kinemat viscos is squar meter per second wherea the cgs unit for kinemat viscos is the stoke (st, or = name after sir georg gabriel stokes. in u.s. usage, stoke is sometim use as the singular form. the submultipl centistok (cst) is often use instead, cst = = the kinemat viscos of water at \u00b0c is about cst. the most frequent use system of us customary, or imperial, unit are the british gravit (bg) and english engin (ee). in the bg system, dynam viscos has unit of pound-second per squar foot and in the ee system it has unit of pound-force-second per squar foot note that the pound and pound-forc are equivalent; the two system differ onli in how forc and mass are defined. in the bg system the pound is a basic unit from which the unit of mass (the slug) is defin by newton second law, wherea in the ee system the unit of forc and mass (the pound-forc and pound-mass respectively) are defin independ through the second law use the proport constant gc. kinemat viscos has unit of squar feet per second in both the bg and ee systems. nonstandard unit includ the reyn, a british unit of dynam viscosity. in the automot industri the viscos index is use to describ the chang of viscos with temperature. the reciproc of viscos is fluidity, usual symbol by \u03d5 = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\phi } or f = / \u03bc {\\displaystyl } , depend on the convent used, measur in reciproc pois or sometim call the rhe. fluiditi is seldom use in engin practice. at one time the petroleum industri reli on measur kinemat viscos by mean of the saybolt viscometer, and express kinemat viscos in unit of saybolt univers second (sus). other abbrevi such as ssu (saybolt second universal) or suv (saybolt univers viscosity) are sometim used. kinemat viscos in centistok can be convert from sus accord to the arithmet and the refer tabl provid in astm d == molecular origin == in general, the viscos of a system depend in detail on how the molecul constitut the system interact. there are no simpl but correct express for the viscos of a fluid. the simplest exact express are the green\u2013kubo relat for the linear shear viscos or the transient time correl function express deriv by evan and morriss in although these express are each exact, calcul the viscos of a dens fluid use these relat current requir the use of molecular dynam comput simulations. on the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilut gas. even elementari assumpt about how gas molecul move and interact lead to a basic understand of the molecular origin of viscosity. more sophist treatment can be construct by systemat coarse-grain the equat of motion of the gas molecules. an exampl of such a treatment is chapman\u2013enskog theory, which deriv express for the viscos of a dilut gas from the boltzmann equation.momentum transport in gase is general mediat by discret molecular collisions, and in liquid by attract forc which bind molecul close together. becaus of this, the dynam viscos of liquid are typic much larger than those of gases. === pure gase === viscos in gase aris princip from the molecular diffus that transport momentum between layer of flow. an elementari calcul for a dilut gas at temperatur t {\\displaystyl t} and densiti \u03c1 {\\displaystyl \\rho } give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c1 \u03bb k b t \u03c0 m , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\alpha \\rho \\lambda {\\sqrt {\\frac m}}},} where k b {\\displaystyl k_{\\text{b}}} is the boltzmann constant, m {\\displaystyl m} the molecular mass, and \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } a numer constant on the order of {\\displaystyl . the quantiti \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } , the mean free path, measur the averag distanc a molecul travel between collisions. even without a priori knowledg of \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } , this express has interest implications. in particular, sinc \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is typic invers proport to densiti and increas with temperature, \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } itself should increas with temperatur and be independ of densiti at fix temperature. in fact, both of these predict persist in more sophist treatments, and accur describ experiment observations. note that this behavior run counter to common intuit regard liquids, for which viscos typic decreas with temperature.for rigid elast sphere of diamet \u03c3 {\\displaystyl \\sigma } , \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } can be computed, give \u03bc = \u03b1 \u03c0 / k b m t \u03c3 . {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {\\alpha }{\\pi {\\sqrt {k_{\\text{b}}mt}}{\\sigma in this case \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is independ of temperature, so \u03bc \u221d t / {\\displaystyl \\mu \\propto . for more complic molecular models, however, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } depend on temperatur in a non-trivi way, and simpl kinet argument as use here are inadequate. more fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becom imprecis for particl that interact over a finit range, which limit the use of the concept for describ real-world gases. ==== chapman\u2013enskog theori ==== a techniqu develop by sydney chapman and david enskog in the earli allow a more refin calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } . it is base on the boltzmann equation, which provid a systemat statist descript of a dilut gas in term of intermolecular interactions. as such, their techniqu allow accur calcul of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } for more realist molecular models, such as those incorpor intermolecular attract rather than just hard-cor repulsion. it turn out that a more realist model of interact is essenti for accur predict of the temperatur depend of \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } , which experi show increas more rapid than the t / {\\displaystyl trend predict for rigid elast spheres. indeed, the chapman\u2013enskog analysi show that the predict temperatur depend can be tune by vari the paramet in various molecular models. a simpl exampl is the sutherland model, which describ rigid elast sphere with weak mutual attraction. in such a case, the attract forc can be treat perturbatively, which lead to a particular simpl express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } : \u03bc = \u03c3 ( k b m t \u03c0 ) / ( + s t ) \u2212 , {\\displaystyl \\mu ={\\frac {k_{\\text{b}}mt}{\\pi where s {\\displaystyl s} is independ of temperature, be determin onli by the paramet of the intermolecular attraction. to connect with experiment, it is conveni to rewrit as \u03bc = \u03bc ( t t ) / t + s t + s , {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\mu where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos at temperatur t {\\displaystyl . if \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } is known from experi at t = t {\\displaystyl and at least one other temperature, then s {\\displaystyl s} can be calculated. it turn out that express for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } obtain in this way are accur for a number of gase over a sizabl rang of temperatures. on the other hand, chapman & cowl argu that this success doe not impli that molecul actual interact accord to the sutherland model. rather, they interpret the predict for \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu } as a simpl interpol which is valid for some gase over fix rang of temperature, but otherwis doe not provid a pictur of intermolecular interact which is fundament correct and general. slight more sophist models, such as the lennard-jon potential, may provid a better picture, but onli at the cost of a more opaqu depend on temperature. in some system the assumpt of spheric symmetri must be abandon as well, as is the case for vapor with high polar molecul like ==== bulk viscos ==== in the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscos aris in gase whenev there are non-neglig relax timescal govern the exchang of energi between the translat energi of molecul and their intern energy, e.g. rotat and vibrational. as such, the bulk viscos is {\\displaystyl for a monatom ideal gas, in which the intern energi of molecul in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide, whose molecul possess both rotat and vibrat energy. === pure liquid === in contrast with gases, there is no simpl yet accur pictur for the molecular origin of viscos in liquids. at the simplest level of description, the relat motion of adjac layer in a liquid is oppos primarili by attract molecular forc act across the layer boundary. in this picture, one (correctly) expect viscos to decreas with increas temperature. this is becaus increas temperatur increas the random thermal motion of the molecules, which make it easier for them to overcom their attract interactions.build on this visualization, a simpl theori can be construct in analog with the discret structur of a solid: group of molecul in a liquid are visual as form \"cages\" which surround and enclos singl molecules. these cage can be occupi or unoccupied, and stronger molecular attract correspond to stronger cages. due to random thermal motion, a molecul \"hops\" between cage at a rate which vari invers with the strength of molecular attractions. in equilibrium these \"hops\" are not bias in ani direction. on the other hand, in order for two adjac layer to move relat to each other, the \"hops\" must be bias in the direct of the relat motion. the forc requir to sustain this direct motion can be estim for a given shear rate, lead to where n a {\\displaystyl n_{a}} is the avogadro constant, h {\\displaystyl h} is the planck constant, v {\\displaystyl v} is the volum of a mole of liquid, and t b {\\displaystyl t_{b}} is the normal boil point. this result has the same form as the widespread and accur empir relat where a {\\displaystyl a} and b {\\displaystyl b} are constant fit from data. on the other hand, sever author express caution with respect to this model. error as larg as can be encount use equat compar with fit equat to experiment data. more fundamentally, the physic assumpt under equat have been criticized. it has also been argu that the exponenti depend in equat doe not necessarili describ experiment observ more accur than simpler, non-exponenti expressions.in light of these shortcomings, the develop of a less ad hoc model is a matter of practic interest. forego simplic in favor of precision, it is possibl to write rigor express for viscos start from the fundament equat of motion for molecules. a classic exampl of this approach is irving\u2013kirkwood theory. on the other hand, such express are given as averag over multiparticl correl function and are therefor difficult to appli in practice. in general, empir deriv express (base on exist viscos measurements) appear to be the onli consist reliabl mean of calcul viscos in liquids. === mixtur and blend === ==== gaseous mixtur ==== the same molecular-kinet pictur of a singl compon gas can also be appli to a gaseous mixture. for instance, in the chapman\u2013enskog approach the viscos \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} of a binari mixtur of gase can be written in term of the individu compon viscos \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu , their respect volum fractions, and the intermolecular interactions. as for the single-compon gas, the depend of \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} on the paramet of the intermolecular interact enter through various collision integr which may not be express in term of elementari functions. to obtain usabl express for \u03bc mix {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{mix}}} which reason match experiment data, the collision integr typic must be evalu use some combin of analyt calcul and empir fitting. an exampl of such a procedur is the sutherland approach for the single-compon gas, discuss above. ==== blend of liquid ==== as for pure liquids, the viscos of a blend of liquid is difficult to predict from molecular principles. one method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theori present abov for a pure liquid. this can be done with vari level of sophistication. one use express result from such an analysi is the lederer\u2013roegi equat for a binari mixture: ln \u2061 \u03bc blend = x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc + \u03b1 x x + \u03b1 x ln \u2061 \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\ln \\mu _{\\text{blend}}={\\frac \\mu {\\alpha \\mu where \u03b1 {\\displaystyl \\alpha } is an empir parameter, and x , {\\displaystyl and \u03bc , {\\displaystyl \\mu are the respect mole fraction and viscos of the compon liquids.sinc blend is an import process in the lubric and oil industries, a varieti of empir and proprieti equat exist for predict the viscos of a blend, besid those stem direct from molecular theory. === solut and suspens === ==== aqeuous solut ==== depend on the solut and rang of concentration, an aqueous electrolyt solut can have either a larger or smaller viscos compar with pure water at the same temperatur and pressure. for instance, a salin (sodium chloride) solut has viscos over time that of pure water, wherea a potassium iodid solut has viscos about time that of pure water. an ideal model of dilut electrolyt solut lead to the follow predict for the viscos \u03bc s {\\displaystyl \\mu _{s}} of a solution: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu {c}},} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the solvent, c {\\displaystyl c} is the concentration, and a {\\displaystyl a} is a posit constant which depend on both solvent and solut properties. however, this express is onli valid for veri dilut solutions, have c {\\displaystyl c} less than mol/l. for higher concentrations, addit term are necessari which account for higher-ord molecular correlations: \u03bc s \u03bc = + a c + b c + c c , {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\mu _{s}}{\\mu where b {\\displaystyl b} and c {\\displaystyl c} are fit from data. in particular, a negat valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is abl to account for the decreas in viscos observ in some solutions. estim valu of these constant are shown below for sodium chlorid and potassium iodid at temperatur \u00b0c (mol = mole, l = liter). ==== suspens ==== in a suspens of solid particl (e.g. micron-s sphere suspend in oil), an effect viscos \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be defin in term of stress and strain compon which are averag over a volum larg compar with the distanc between the suspend particles, but small with respect to macroscop dimensions. such suspens general exhibit non-newtonian behavior. however, for dilut system in steadi flows, the behavior is newtonian and express for \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} can be deriv direct from the particl dynamics. in a veri dilut system, with volum fraction \u03d5 \u2272 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\lesssim , interact between the suspend particl can be ignored. in such a case one can explicit calcul the flow field around each particl independently, and combin the result to obtain \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} . for spheres, this result in the einstein equation: \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where \u03bc {\\displaystyl \\mu is the viscos of the suspend liquid. the linear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is a direct consequ of neglect interparticl interactions; in general, one will have \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu \\right),} where the coeffici b {\\displaystyl b} may depend on the particl shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks). experiment determin of the precis valu of b {\\displaystyl b} is difficult, however: even the predict b = / {\\displaystyl for sphere has not been conclus validated, with various experi find valu in the rang \u2272 b \u2272 {\\displaystyl b\\lesssim . this defici has been attribut to difficulti in control experiment conditions.in denser suspensions, \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} acquir a nonlinear depend on \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } , which indic the import of interparticl interactions. various analyt and semi-empir scheme exist for captur this regime. at the most basic level, a term quadrat in \u03d5 {\\displaystyl \\phi } is ad to \u03bc eff {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}} : \u03bc eff = \u03bc ( + b \u03d5 + b \u03d5 ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu _{\\text{eff}}=\\mu and the coeffici b {\\displaystyl is fit from experiment data or approxim from the microscop theory. in general, however, one should be cautious in appli such simpl formula sinc non-newtonian behavior appear in dens suspens ( \u03d5 \u2273 {\\displaystyl \\phi \\gtrsim for spheres), or in suspens of elong or flexibl particles.ther is a distinct between a suspens of solid particles, describ above, and an emulsion. the latter is a suspens of tini droplets, which themselv may exhibit intern circulation. the presenc of intern circul can notic decreas the observ effect viscosity, and differ theoret or semi-empir model must be used. === amorph materi === in the high and low temperatur limits, viscous flow in amorph materi (e.g. in glass and melts) has the arrhenius form: \u03bc = a e q / ( r t ) , {\\displaystyl \\mu =ae^{q/(rt)},} where q is a relev activ energy, given in term of molecular parameters; t is temperature; r is the molar gas constant; and a is approxim a constant. the activ energi q take a differ valu depend on whether the high or low temperatur limit is be considered: it chang from a high valu qh at low temperatur (in the glassi state) to a low valu ql at high temperatur (in the liquid state). for intermedi temperatures, q {\\displaystyl q} vari nontrivi with temperatur and the simpl arrhenius form fails. on the other hand, the two-exponenti equat \u03bc = a t exp \u2061 ( b r t ) [ + c exp \u2061 ( d r t ) ] , {\\displaystyl \\mu =at\\exp \\left({\\frac \\left({\\frac {d}{rt}}\\right)\\right],} where a {\\displaystyl a} , b {\\displaystyl b} , c {\\displaystyl c} , d {\\displaystyl d} are all constants, provid a good fit to experiment data over the entir rang of temperatures, while at the same time reduc to the correct arrhenius form in the low and high temperatur limits. besid be a conveni fit to data, the express can also be deriv from various theoret model of amorph materi at the atom level.a two-exponenti equat for the viscos can be deriv within the dyre shove model of supercool liquids, where the arrhenius energi barrier is identifi with the high-frequ shear modulus time a characterist shove volume. upon specifi the temperatur depend of the shear modulus via thermal expans and via the repuls part of the intermolecular potential, anoth two-exponenti equat is retrieved: \u03bc = exp \u2061 { v c c g k b t exp \u2061 [ ( + \u03bb ) \u03b1 t t g ( \u2212 t t g ) ] } {\\displaystyl \\mu =\\exp {\\left\\{{\\frac {v_{c}c_{g}}{k_{b}t}}\\exp )\\alpha {t}{t_{g}}}\\right)\\right]}\\right\\}}} where c g {\\displaystyl c_{g}} denot the high-frequ shear modulus of the materi evalu at a temperatur equal to the glass transit temperatur t g {\\displaystyl t_{g}} , v c {\\displaystyl v_{c}} is the so-cal shove volume, i.e. it is the characterist volum of the group of atom involv in the shove event by which an atom/molecul escap from the cage of nearest-neighbours, typic on the order of the volum occupi by few atoms. furthermore, \u03b1 t {\\displaystyl \\alpha _{t}} is the thermal expans coeffici of the material, \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\lambda } is a paramet which measur the steep of the power-law rise of the ascend flank of the first peak of the radial distribut function, and is

strategi is to ignor the small-scal vortic (or eddies) in the motion and to calcul a large-scal motion with an effect viscosity, call the \"eddi viscosity\", which character the transport and dissip of energi in the smaller-scal flow (see larg eddi simulation). in contrast to the viscos of the fluid itself, which must be posit by the second law of thermodynamics, the eddi viscos can be negative. == select substanc == observ valu of viscos vari over sever order of magnitude, even for common substanc (see the order of magnitud tabl below). for instance, a sucros (sugar) solut has a viscos over

quantity. == in wave propag == for period wave in nondispers media (that is, media in which the wave speed is independ of frequency), frequenc has an invers relationship to the wavelength, \u03bb (lambda). even in dispers media, the frequenc f of a sinusoid wave is equal to the phase veloc v of the wave divid by the wavelength \u03bb of the wave: f = v \u03bb . {\\displaystyl f={\\frac

f={\\frac {c}{\\lambda }}.} when wave from a monochrom sourc travel from one medium to another, their frequenc remain the same\u2014on their wavelength and speed change. == measur == measur of frequenc can be done in the follow ways, === count === calcul the frequenc of a repeat event is accomplish by count the number of time that event occur within a specif time period, then divid the count by the length of the time period. for example, if event occur within second the frequenc is: f = s \u2248 hz {\\displaystyl f={\\frac if the number of count is not veri large, it is more accur to measur the time interv for a predetermin number of occurrences, rather than the number of occurr within a specifi time. the latter method introduc a random error into the count of between zero and one count, so on averag half a count. this is call gate error and caus an averag error in the calcul frequenc of \u03b4 f = t m {\\displaystyl \\delta f={\\frac , or a fraction error of \u03b4 f f = f t m {\\displaystyl {\\frac {\\delta f}{f}}={\\frac where t {\\displaystyl t} is the time interv and f {\\displaystyl f} is the measur frequency. this error decreas with frequency, so it is general a problem at low frequenc where the number of count n is small. === stroboscop === an older method of measur the frequenc of rotat or vibrat object is to use a stroboscope. this is an intens repetit flash light (strobe light) whose frequenc can be adjust with a calibr time circuit. the strobe light is point at the rotat object and the frequenc adjust up and down. when the frequenc of the strobe equal the frequenc of the rotat or vibrat object, the object complet one cycl of oscil and return to it origin posit between the flash of light, so when illumin by the strobe the object appear stationary. then the frequenc can be read from the calibr readout on the stroboscope. a downsid of this method is that an object rotat at an integr multipl of the strobe frequenc will also appear stationary. === frequenc counter === higher frequenc are usual measur with a frequenc counter. this is an electron instrument which measur the frequenc of an appli repetit electron signal and display the result in hertz on a digit display. it use digit logic to count the number of cycl dure a time interv establish by a precis quartz time base. cyclic process that are not electrical, such as the rotat rate of a shaft, mechan vibrations, or sound waves, can be convert to a repetit electron signal by transduc and the signal appli to a frequenc counter. as of frequenc counter can cover the rang up to about ghz. this repres the limit of direct count methods; frequenc abov this must be measur by indirect methods. === heterodyn method === abov the rang of frequenc counters, frequenc of electromagnet signal are often measur indirect util heterodyn (frequenc conversion). a refer signal of a known frequenc near the unknown frequenc is mix with the unknown frequenc in a nonlinear mix devic such as a diode. this creat a heterodyn or \"beat\" signal at the differ between the two frequencies. if the two signal are close togeth in frequenc the heterodyn is low enough to be measur by a frequenc counter. this process onli measur the differ between the unknown frequenc and the refer frequency. to reach higher frequencies, sever stage of heterodyn can be used. current research is extend this method to infrar and light frequenc (optic heterodyn detection). == exampl == === light === visibl light is an electromagnet wave, consist of oscil electr and magnet field travel through space. the frequenc of the wave determin it color: thz hz) is red light, thz hz) is violet light, and between these (in the rang thz) are all the other color of the visibl spectrum. an electromagnet wave with a frequenc less than hz will be invis to the human eye; such wave are call infrar (ir) radiation. at even lower frequency, the wave is call a microwave, and at still lower frequenc it is call a radio wave. likewise, an electromagnet wave with a frequenc higher than hz will also be invis to the human eye; such wave are call ultraviolet (uv) radiation. even higher-frequ wave are call x-rays, and higher still are gamma rays. all of these waves, from the lowest-frequ radio wave to the highest-frequ gamma rays, are fundament the same, and they are all call electromagnet radiation. they all travel through a vacuum at the same speed (the speed of light), give them wavelength invers proport to their frequencies. c = f \u03bb {\\displaystyl \\displaystyl c=f\\lambda } where c is the speed of light (c in a vacuum or less in other media), f is the frequenc and \u03bb is the wavelength. in dispers media, such as glass, the speed depend somewhat on frequency, so the wavelength is not quit invers proport to frequency. === sound === sound propag as mechan vibrat wave of pressur and displacement, in air or other substances. in general, frequenc compon of a sound determin it \"color\", it timbre. when speak about the frequenc (in singular) of a sound, it mean the properti that most determin pitch.th frequenc an ear can hear are limit to a specif rang of frequencies. the audibl frequenc rang for human is typic given as be between about hz and hz khz), though the high frequenc limit usual reduc with age. other speci have differ hear ranges. for example, some dog breed can perceiv vibrat up to hz.in mani media, such as air, the speed of sound is approxim independ of frequency, so the wavelength of the sound wave (distanc between repetitions) is approxim invers proport to frequency. === line current === in europe, africa, australia, southern south america, most of asia, and russia, the frequenc of the altern current in household electr outlet is hz (close to the tone g), wherea in north america and northern south america, the frequenc of the altern current in household electr outlet is hz (between the tone b\u266d and b; that is, a minor third abov the

from the begin point, the direct of the distanc be determin by rotat the first cardin direct the specifi angl toward the second cardin direction. for example, north west feet would describ a line run from the start point feet in a direct (or away from north toward the west. === firearm === the arcminut is common found in the firearm industri and literature, particular concern the precis of rifles, though the industri refer to it as minut of angl (moa). it is especi popular as a unit of measur with shooter familiar with the imperi measur system becaus moa subtend a circl with a diamet of inch (which is often round to just inch) at yard cm at m or cm at m), a tradit distanc on american target ranges. the subtens is linear with the distance, for example, at yards, moa subtend inches, and at yard moa subtend inches. sinc mani modern telescop sight are adjust in half quarter or eighth moa increments, also known as clicks, zero and adjust are made by count and click per moa respectively. for example, if the point of impact is inch high and inch left of the point of aim at yard (which for instanc could be measur by use a spot scope with a calibr reticle), the scope need to be adjust moa down, and moa right. such adjust are trivial when the scope adjust dial have a moa scale print on them, and even figur the right number of click is relat easi on scope that click in fraction of moa. this make zero and adjust much easier: to adjust a moa scope moa down and moa right, the scope need to be adjust \u00d7 = click down and x = click right to adjust a moa scope moa down and moa right, the scope need to be adjust x = click down and \u00d7 = click right to adjust a moa scope moa down and moa right, the scope need to be adjust x = click down and \u00d7 = click rightanoth common system of measur in firearm scope is the milliradian (mrad). zero an mrad base scope is easi for user familiar with base ten systems. the most common adjust valu in mrad base scope is mrad (which approxim moa). to adjust a mrad scope mrad down and mrad right, the scope need to be adjust click down and click right (which equal approxim and moa respectively).on thing to be awar of is that some moa scopes, includ some higher-end models, are calibr such that an adjust of moa on the scope knob correspond to exact inch of impact adjust on a target at yards, rather than the mathemat correct inches. this is common known as the shooter moa (smoa) or inch per hundr yard (iphy). while the differ between one true moa and one smoa is less than half of an inch even at yards, this error compound signific on longer rang shot that may requir adjust upward of moa to compens for the bullet drop. if a shot requir an adjust of moa or more, the differ between true moa and smoa will add up to inch or more. in competit target shooting, this might mean the differ between a hit and a miss. the physic group size equival to m minut of arc can be calcul as follows: group size = \u00d7 distance. in the exampl previous given, for minut of arc, and substitut inch for yards, \u2248 inches. in metric unit moa at metr \u2248 centimetres. sometimes, a precision-ori firearm perform will be measur in moa. this simpli mean that under ideal condit (i.e. no wind, high-grad ammo, clean barrel, and a stabl mount platform such as a vise or a benchrest use to elimin shooter error), the gun is capabl of produc a group of shot whose center point (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the averag diamet of circl in sever group can be subtend by that amount of arc. for example, a moa rifl should be capable, under ideal conditions, of repeat shoot group at yards. most higher-end rifl are warranti by their manufactur to shoot under a given moa threshold (typic moa or better) with specif ammunit and no error on the shooter part. for example, remington sniper weapon system is requir to shoot moa or better, or be reject from sale by qualiti control. rifl manufactur and gun magazin often refer to this capabl as sub-moa, mean a gun consist shoot group under moa. this mean that a singl group of to shot at yards, or the averag of sever groups, will measur less than moa between the two furthest shot in the group, i.e. all shot fall within moa. if larger sampl are taken (i.e., more shot per group) then group size typic increases, howev this will ultim averag out. if a rifl was truli a moa rifle, it would be just as like that two consecut shot land exact on top of each other as that they land moa apart. for groups, base on confidence, a rifl that normal shoot moa can be expect to shoot group between moa and moa, although the major of these group will be under moa. what this mean in practic is if a rifl that shoot group on averag at yard shoot a group measur inch follow by a group that is inches, this is not statist abnormal.th metric system counterpart of the moa is the milliradian (mrad or mil'), be equal to one of the target range, laid out on a circl that has the observ as centr and the target rang as radius. the number of milliradian on a full such circl therefor alway is equal to \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 regardless the target range. therefore, moa \u2248 mrad. this mean that an object which span mrad on the reticl is at a rang that is in metr equal to the object size in millimetr (e.g. an object of mm subtend mrad is metr away). so there is no convers factor required, contrari to the moa system. a reticl with mark (hash or dots) space with a one mrad apart (or a fraction of a mrad) are collect call a mrad reticle. if the mark are round they are call mil-dots. in the tabl below convers from mrad to metric valu are exact (e.g. mrad equal exact mm at metres), while convers of minut of arc to both metric and imperi valu are approximate. at yard is about inch \u2248 mrad (or mm at m, approxim mm at m) mrad \u2248 so mrad \u2248 mrad equal exact cm at m, or approxim inch at yard === human vision === in humans, vision is the abil to resolv a spatial pattern separ by a visual angl of one minut of arc. a letter subtend minut of arc total. === materi === the deviat from parallel between two surfaces, for instanc in optic engineering, is usual measur in arcminut or arcseconds. in addition, arcsecond are sometim use in rock curv (\u03c9-scan) x ray diffract measur of high-qual epitaxi thin films. === manufactur === some measur devic make use of arcminut and arcsecond to measur angl when the object be measur is too small for direct visual inspection. for instance, a toolmak optic compar will often includ an option to measur in \"minut and seconds\". == see also == degre (angle) \u00a7 subdivis sexagesim \u00a7 modern usag squar minut squar second steradian milliradian == note == == refer == == extern link == moa/ mil by robert simeon a
